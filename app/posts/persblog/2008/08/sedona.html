Today I went to the Navajo Arts and Culture festival at the Museum of Northern Arizona, which is just around the corner from my house.  I did a quick tour.  There were some interesting paintings, but it was mostly weaving and jewelry which were not too interesting to me.  The museum does have a nice exhibit about the Therizinosaur, a new species of dinosaur that they discovered in Arizona recently. After that I drove down to check out Sedona, which is about 50 minutes south of Flagstaff. The road takes you through some gorgeous scenery including Oak Creek Canyon and <a href="http://www.gatewaytosedona.com/article/id/252/page/1">Slide Rock State Park</a>.  I walked around the touristy streets and shops in Sedona a bit, and had a nice long lunch with phone calls to my parents and Thorp.  I waited out a thunderstorm, then checked out a few of the nearby lookout points with views of the red rock formations.
