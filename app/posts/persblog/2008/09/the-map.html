Oh my God, you guys, Susan Oetgen's second <a href="http://www.myspace.com/likenesstolily">Likeness to Lily</a> album is almost out!  Susan is a beautiful singer that I met through my brother.  She's trained operatically but has been composing for and singing in an eclectic jazz/pop band for a few years.  She's got a gorgeous voice that I find mesmerizing.  Her songs tend to be sad and focused on the struggles of love (first album) and war (the second album).  I probably saw almost ten of their live shows in NYC in 2006-2007.  A very special group and as of yet unsigned and not well known.  Also check out her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJScLfwD0r4">Fairwell, Recruit</a> video.
