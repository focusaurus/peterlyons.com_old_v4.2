Allow me to pose a question. What could be better than roller derby?&nbsp; That's right! MORE roller derby.&nbsp; I happened across an ad for another contest this Saturday between another local team called the <a href="http://www.lavacityrollerdolls.com/">Lava City Roller Dolls</a> versus the visiting <a href="http://www.slaughtercountyrollervixens.com/">Slaughter County Roller Vixens</a>.&nbsp; Oh such great delight.&nbsp; This event was different from the previous one.&nbsp; This was much more official: held in a real roller rink as opposed to a music venue, involving far more referees who seemed more concerned with accurate score tally, and having distinct rules and a penalty system.&nbsp; So the rules part kind of stinks, but absent the flagrant tripping and throwing, the general body checking and frequent pile-ups were all there.

Today I walked up the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_Butte_(Oregon)">Pilot Butte</a> and got a nice look across the town.
