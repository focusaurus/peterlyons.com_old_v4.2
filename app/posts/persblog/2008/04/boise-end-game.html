OK folks, it's just about time to pack up camp and move on.  I've mostly gotten into my routine of work, sax, climbing here.  Last weekend on Saturday I drove up to Bogus Basin to check out the local ski hill.  You drive from downtown Boise where it is spring weather and sunny, 16 miles up a windy mountain road, gaining 4000 feet in elevation, and you are at <a href="http://www.bogusbasin.org/">Bogus Basin</a>.  I paid $25 (cheap!) for the lift ticket and skied a bit.  It was cloudly, cold (compared to downtown), and snowing a bit.  I explored the back side briefly but I started to feel a bit dizzy and the flat light made it hard to see contour, so I headed home early.

Tomorrow night I'm headed to another Boise Philharmonic concert, and then Saturday morning I drive to Bend, Oregon for phase six!

Here's my favorite bouldering route at the local rock gym. Gratuitous pull-ups included at no extra charge.
