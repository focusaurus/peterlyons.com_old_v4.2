I really liked <a href="http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html">this article on the cultural shift from consumption of media to include creation and sharing of media</a>. I try to apply this idea not just to media but to just in general favoring activities that are participatory as opposed to purely things you experience passively.  For a long time, I've looked at enthused sports fans with their faces painted and thought, if there was a way that somehow the fans could be directly involved in the game, if only very simplistically, it would be a huge hit and I'd make a fortune.  Even just little buttons on the seats at the stadium that could extend the shot clock if enough people hit them frantically enough or something along those lines would be a start.  I'd have to say that hands-down my favorite get-out-there-and-do-stuff activity while I was in NYC was the <a href="http://www.metrometroland.com">MetroMetro Scavenger Hunt</a>.
