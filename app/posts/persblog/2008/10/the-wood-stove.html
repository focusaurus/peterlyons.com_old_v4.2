Well, no luck so far on the house hunt.  I've seen two interesting properties go under contract, but at this point I've pretty much seen every interesting property on the market in Louisville.  I've also seen a lot of places in Lafayette and Broomfield, and in general have a much better idea of what's out there and what I will and will not like.  However, after a month of searching it seems that I am in "wait for new listings" mode, unfortunately, which means I have to make additional temporary housing plans and in general extend my limbo period.

I did, however, finally have enough free time on a weekend to go for a hike. I hiked about seven miles in Eldorado Canyon State Park on Sunday.  The weather was gray and threatening rain all day, but it never amounted to more than a drizzle, thankfully.

Practicing has been going well here in the mountains.  Today I felt extra rugged as I fired up the wood stove for the first time.  That thing works pretty well.
