I bought a mountain bike!  It's the first bike I've owned since college.  I don't have a photo yet, but I'll take one shortly.  I got it used from craigslist of course, and my landlord/roommate Mike was kind enough to apply his bike repair expertise and supply of spare parts to get it into working order.  I learned a few things about bike maintenance including how to change out the tubes, what tubes with slime are, that you can actually adjust the spokes of a bike wheel individually to make the rim straight (who knew!), and so forth.  I'm now very pleased that I can bike the 4.5 miles into town where the rock gym is.  I got the whole nine yards of accessories too - helmet, front and rear lights, and a lock (which altogether cost about as much as the bike itself).  I have successfully ridden back home from the rock gym at night, so I plan to be doing a lot of biking.  Of course, the neighborhood I live in in NW Flagstaff (Chesire) provides the best access to the copious mountain bike trails, so pretty much every house here has six or more bikes in the garage.

Last night they had a movie being projected in the main town square, and it was a good opportunity to take a look at the locals.  A fairly motley mix of folks, and lots of tweens running around and chasing each other.  Today it was a very rare (I'm told) day of on and off rain all day, so I did some shopping around town. I visited Bookman's used book store as well as Cedar Music, wherein I was pleasantly surprised to find a large selection of classical saxophone music.  I left with $70 worth of music for solo saxophone.

Tonight my roommates/landlords and I had Thai dinner in town and I picked their brains for things to do while I'm here, so now I have a good sized list.
