w00t!&nbsp; I'm all excited to be here in Boise.&nbsp; My Park City landlord got home last night and we went to the Eccles Center for the Performing Arts to see <a href="http://www.pacificodance.com/">Pacifico Dance Company</a> do Mexican music and dance.&nbsp; It was a nice show with a good mariachi band and great colorful dresses.&nbsp; This morning I packed up and headed out.&nbsp; It was a delightful drive.&nbsp; I'm worried that these monthly long drives to a new town are becoming addictive to me.&nbsp; I was so excited to get on the road - partially because I deprive myself of certain "road trip only" albums all month, and then I finally have carte blanche access to them in the car.&nbsp; Initially I selected Miles Davis Miles Ahead and it was just one of those times when your whole being is perfectly primed to enjoy that one specific record.&nbsp; I was loving it.&nbsp; The drive is a simple straight shot on 84 West at 75 MPH the whole way, so I actually did it in one tank of gas and just under five hours.&nbsp; The oil change last helped and the green machine got about 35 MPG.

Kate has always warned me about the perils of "The I States", but I must test my mettle.

Got clouds?&nbsp; "Big Sky" is supposed to be Montana, but since Idaho's license plate is the oh-so-lame "Famous Potatoes", they should get a slogan like "Our Sky Is Also Rather Large".

When I arrived I met my landlord's father Clark, who showed me the place.&nbsp; It's on a nice street with a real suburban feel with lawns and porches and so forth.&nbsp; The apartment itself is (as was to be expected) a bit of a step down from Gunter's ski house, but it's OK.&nbsp; It's the basement of a duplex with the landlords, who are currently in Panama, living upstairs.&nbsp; Of course, the Internet connection works great, which is vastly more important than anything else including heat or light.

Clark was very friendly and helpful to me. Again, somehow I seem to have pretty good craigslist luck.&nbsp; He asked what outdoor activities I liked to do, said they would take me on a whitewater rafting trip in a few weeks, and immediately went home to get his old mountain bike, filled the tires, and lent it to me.&nbsp; Then he drove me around the neighborhood pointing out the pedestrian retail pavilions, bike trails, numerous parks, how to get to the skiing at Bogus Basin, etc.&nbsp; After he left and I made a run to get a desk and chair since the apartment didn't have anything suitable for laptop work, I took the bike out for an exploratory ride.&nbsp; Oh I should mention that I experienced instant spring as it was cold and piles of snow in Park City at 9am and here it was mid fifties and gorgeous Spring at 2pm.&nbsp; Tons of people were out walking (many with dogs), biking (two tandem bikes spotted), skateboarding (there are numerous skate parks), and playing baseball.&nbsp; I biked to The Green Belt, a long bike/walk path and I rode next to a golf course and the river a ways.&nbsp; I grabbed a copy of Boise Weekly and was giddy to discover Les Claypool (alternative metal bass genius with application for demigod status under consideration) will be playing here on Saturday.

<p>
So far so good.&nbsp; I'm completely unpacked (takes about 15 minutes for stuff plus 30 for computers, wireless network, etc). On first impression, Boise is equivalent to the bomb.&nbsp;
