OK, things are about to wrap up here in Bend.&nbsp; We had unseasonably hot weather in the upper nineties this weekend.&nbsp; Saturday I walked around the park and bit and played some sax.&nbsp; Sunday I rented a kayak and cruised around the Deschutes river a bit.&nbsp; Lots of folks were out in kayaks, tubes, air mattresses, inflatable turtles, etc.&nbsp; It was also the day of the kids pole, pedal, paddle race, so there were rafting boats full of kids being dumped into the river at regular intervals.&nbsp; Just one more week here in then and then travel craziness begins.&nbsp; I'll be in at least four states in June.&nbsp; Craigslist Flagstaff is pretty quiet, so I might not be able to get housing there. Wish me luck.
