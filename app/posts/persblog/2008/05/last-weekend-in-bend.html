OK, things are about to wrap up here in Bend. We had unseasonably hot weather in the upper nineties this weekend. Saturday I walked around the park and bit and played some sax. Sunday I rented a kayak and cruised around the Deschutes river a bit. Lots of folks were out in kayaks, tubes, air mattresses, inflatable turtles, etc. It was also the day of the kids pole, pedal, paddle race, so there were rafting boats full of kids being dumped into the river at regular intervals. Just one more week here in then and then travel craziness begins. I'll be in at least four states in June. Craigslist Flagstaff is pretty quiet, so I might not be able to get housing there. Wish me luck.
