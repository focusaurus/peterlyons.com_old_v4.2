Just prior to Burning Man at the end of August, one of my super cheap-o set of computer speakers (small stereo pair plus sub woofer, "CA" brand) stopped working.  I was packed pretty full, so I tossed the other speaker and sub woofer.  Since then I haven't had speakers.  I have been using the tiny built-in speakers on my laptop or occasionally headphones.

When things finally stabilized enough to where "get new speakers" bubbled up to the top of the to-do list, I did some shopping online, tried to get some from the fancy high end audio store in town, but ended up ordering a pair of M-Audio Studiophile AV40s.  They are not premium speakers - just about one notch better than the Logitec or Creative Labs stuff you can get in Best Buy.

Holy crap.  My life is significantly better.  It's amazing.  They sound great and I can feel the music in the air.  Everything is so much more powerful this way.  Man.  It's intense.  I've been missing it.  Now I just can't wait unti I get my own house so I can buy the kick-ass home stereo of my dreams.

In other news, <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com">Rhapsody</a> finally has some Tracy Chapman and some Nirvana.  This week <a href="http://ikioi.livejournal.com/">ikioi</a> left on Monday morning and I've been working pretty hard these three days.  The project is at the exciting phase where it's starting to come together and be able to do real work, which is fun.  And man, it's nice to not be writing design documents.
