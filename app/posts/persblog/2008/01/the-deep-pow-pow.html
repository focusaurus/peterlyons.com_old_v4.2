So things are cruising along nicely here in Boulder.&nbsp; I've been skiing at<a href="http://www.skiwinterpark.com/"> Winter Park</a>,<a href="http://www.eldora.com/"> Eldora</a>, and <a href="http://www.coppercolorado.com/">Copper Mountain</a> so far.&nbsp; I've been loving the huge King Soopers supermarket that is open 24 hours and the Boulder Rock Club is great.&nbsp; The cats have been fun and amusing when they aren't pooping or puking out of the litter box, which they do fairly regularly.&nbsp; I busted Fred the neighbor's cat stealing food a few times, too.&nbsp; I've been trying to get Elise in to Six Feet Under with good results so far and I have the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/blueplanet/">BBC Blue Planet documentaries</a> here from NetFlix, which are pretty cool.

I'm reading up a lot on house buying and trying to get my finances understood and in order so I can get a mortgage, etc.&nbsp; I'm going for a consultation with Uncle Bill's financial advisor tomorrow. Hopefully he won't react as poorly as my banker when I explained how all my Opsware stock earnings would be taxed in 2007: &quot;Oh that is going to kill you. (Head in hands) That is definitely going to kill you.&quot;

Today I took off again to go skiing.&nbsp; We went to Copper Mountain again and it was just spectacular. They had about five inches of fresh snow, sunny with a few scattered clouds, and zero wind.&nbsp; It was a bit cold (15 degrees at the base) but we seemed to stay comfortable.&nbsp; Elise, Les, and I took a group lesson on skiing bumps.&nbsp; The lesson goes from 10 to 3.&nbsp; In the morning in addition to our instructor Donny, we had Tom who is Donny's supervisor and also a good teacher, and Jerry, a ski patrol guy who was tagging along for the fun of it.&nbsp; We all got some really good pointers and made a lot of progress on skiing moguls with the contemporary technique.&nbsp; Poor Les was struggling a little bit since she has been skiing with her skis completely together in a tight slalom for a few decades and it's hard to adjust to the modern technique of having skiis about six inches apart.&nbsp; The snow was perhaps the best I have skied.&nbsp; We covered a lot of terrain (all with moguls) including the Spaulding Bowl on the back side.&nbsp; The scenery at Copper Mountain is really spectacular at points, often enough to make you forget you're at 12,000 feet above the tree line in single digit temperatures.
