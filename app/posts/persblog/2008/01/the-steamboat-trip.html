I had an adventurous weekend this weekend.&nbsp; Well, Friday wasn't adventurous, but I went to the rock climbing gym.&nbsp; Saturday I packed up the car and set out to explore a few smaller towns around Boulder.&nbsp; I visited Louisville first, and found it to be really very nice. The outskirts are mostly recent but not brand new housing developments.&nbsp; The nice thing is that they are clearly housing development communities built by a single developer but they have stand alone houses (&quot;detached single family dwellings&quot; as I've learned in my home buying studies) as opposed to townhouses, which is nice.&nbsp; The downtown area is small but very nice. I checked out the public library and walked through most of town and a few nearby residential blocks while catching up with Kate on the phone.&nbsp; Downtown is almost all local boutiques and restaurants, which is nice.&nbsp; I had lunch at Bob's specialty sandwich shop, and they have a chocolate shop as well, which is a plus.&nbsp; It seems many things are only open Saturday morning, though.&nbsp; Anyway, Louisville is a definite possibility.&nbsp; I saw a few houses for sale and even one that was having an open house, but I couldn't muster the moxy to go in and tour it.<br /><br />From Louisville I went out in search of Broomfield.&nbsp; I searched, but all I found was gigantic strip malls and endless townhouse developments.&nbsp; I couldn't seem to locate anything resembling a town center, so Broomfield seems out.&nbsp; Next I made the longer drive toward Greeley, navigating by the wallet-sized map of Colorado in my U.S. road atlas, which leaves some details as an excercise to the driver.&nbsp; On my way there, I passed through Longmont.&nbsp; The Longmont downtown was decent, but I was a bit set back by a few pawn shops, gun stores, and some office dealing in &quot;Corrections Management&quot; or something like that.

<p>
Next was Greeley, which turned out to be just awful from what I could tell.&nbsp; The downtown is approached by a Route-22-esque highway packed with strip malls on either side.&nbsp; Downtown itself has a weird ghost town feel and was mostly desolate around three in the afternoon on a Saturday.&nbsp; There are also train tracks dividing the town in half and limiting the number of places you can cross.&nbsp; Beyond down town the residential neighborhoods were totally unappealing.&nbsp; All the houses looked like they peaked in about 1972 and had been poorly maintained since then.&nbsp; Definitely off the list.
</p>
<p>
From there I headed out to Steamboat Springs, having packed up all my ski gear in the car in the morning.&nbsp; On the way I drove through Fort Collins where HP has a big office, but I didn't explore at all as I wanted to do as much of my drive to Steamboat in the waning daylight.&nbsp; I may go to Fort Collins one day this week to check it out.&nbsp; The drive to Steamboat was rough.&nbsp; I only had daylight for the first hour, and then I drove most of the four-hour journey only the 2-lane, windy, steep, mountainous highway 14.&nbsp; It was slow going indeed and icy in some spots.&nbsp; Sadly the roads here are mostly not black but a very washed out light gray that is low-contrast to what's left of the white side lines and yellow center lines.&nbsp; Add to that a layer of dirt and you're basically driving by the patterns from tire marks in the road.&nbsp; Apparently they haven't figured out the whole reflectors in the road thing.&nbsp; I had good music with me, but the drive was still very long and slow and nerve racking. Although that first hour in daylight was pretty scenic.&nbsp; I pulled over at one point to get some snacks from the trunk and looked up at the sky.&nbsp; This was when it was completely dark and I was deep into the mountains.&nbsp; The night was clear and the sky was awe inspiring.&nbsp; I only glanced up a moment though as it was cold and windy and I wanted to keep on trucking.

As an aside I want to state for the record that Queen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sheer-Heart-Attack-Queen/dp/B000000OAA/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1201593178&amp;sr=8-1">Shear Heart Attack</a> is the greatest album of all time.
</p>

I arrived at Steamboat Springs around 9 pm and hunted down a motel room.&nbsp; Even the Super Eight was $108/night, sadly, but I gues that's the story in a destination resort.&nbsp; Then I drove into town, walked up and down the street a bit to check it out, and then selected a Mexican restaurant for my ski-fuel burrito.&nbsp; I ate quickly and headed back to hit the sack.

Sunday I skiied the world famous Steamboat Springs.&nbsp; The first few runs the light was incredibly flat due to cloud cover, so there's just not enough relief to see the terrain.&nbsp; It literally was like skiing on a white photographer's backdrop - except the backdrop wasn't flat.&nbsp; However, the sun did come out for about two hours in the latemorning, which was terrific.&nbsp; I found some nice runs with some scattered trees that had deep snow and interesting features.&nbsp; One thing that Steamboat does really well is make runs where the only clear away some of the trees to give you a nice middle ground between a fully cleared slope and dense tree skiing.&nbsp; Steamboat is also recognizable for the fact that much of the forest is birch trees in addition to the more common pines.&nbsp; There was plenty of snow, although it was not fresh so it was a bit heavy and sticky.
</p>
<p>
I stopped for lunch at a small mid-mountain hut that was standing room only so I had to eat outside.&nbsp; By this time the wind had picked up considerably and the cloud cover was returning.&nbsp; This was almost enough to get me bummed out, but I decided to go check out the back side of the mountain where they have some bowls and more open skiing.&nbsp; The skiing on the back side was really great and very new for me.&nbsp; I even took off my skis and hiked up to one of the double black diamond runs.&nbsp; The first bit was very steep but had the deepest powder I have skied in, so you don't have to worry about falling because it's two feet of fluffy snow the whole slope.&nbsp; So I made my way down that and into the next section which was denser trees, which I navigated a bit cautiously since I don't ski with a helmet (although I think next year I might start).&nbsp; Once I got down through those trees it dumps you out into a vast flat clearing.&nbsp; This was just spectacular.&nbsp; It really gave me a sense of how beautiful the snow-covered trees are and the fact that I had to hike a ways then ski down a double black diamond to get to it made me feel priveleged to be there.&nbsp; There are some photos and a video linked below.

I ended up skiing until past 3:30, which is somewhat unusual, before taking the shuttle back to free parking and getting ready to head home.&nbsp; I thought because I was taking a different route back to Boulder I might get to a respectable highway sooner, but no such luck.&nbsp; The drive back ended up being even more treacherous than the drive there - partly because this time there was more traffic building up behind me in my slow moving Sentra.&nbsp; I had to pull over about four or five times to let faster traffic pass on the steep, curvy, mountain roads in total darkness.&nbsp; After over three hours of bare knuckle driving I was relieved to finally get onto I-70 and drive 25 mph in traffic toward Denver.&nbsp; I forget which road I was getting on to, but toward the end getting onto 93 north or maybe route 6 as I made the left hand turn onto the road from the off-ramp of the previous road, again thanks to the zero-contrast road painting plus fatigue, I very briefly drove the wrong direction on a divided highway.&nbsp; It only took me a few yards to realize my mistake, and thankfully there were no cars in sight in either direction (initially), but let me tell you, that realization gets your heart rate going.&nbsp; Thankfully, I was able to make a quick U turn and get back on the correct side going the correct direction with only one car passing me in the other lane head on.

I was surely relieved to arrive back home in Boulder and scratch my puddy tats. Note to self: no driving in the mountains at night.
