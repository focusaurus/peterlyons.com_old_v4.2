I took off Friday to go skiing at Winter Park with the whole crew: Les, Anne, Elise, and Lewis.&nbsp; It was overcast in the morning but sunny and nice in the afternoon.

Afterward Bill made us another delicious dinner.&nbsp; Saturday I had lunch downtown in the Pearl St pedestrian mall area.&nbsp; It was unseasonably warm - 60 degrees, which was nice.&nbsp; Today I went again to the Boulder Rock Gym and did some nice climbing and exercising.&nbsp; It's a really nice big gym.
