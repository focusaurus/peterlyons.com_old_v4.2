Well, I finally got the green machine to a repair shop. I think sometime in Bend it started running really really loud especially in low gear.  It sounded like a motorcycle with no muffler. As would be expected, I had to shell out a large bucket of cash, but man is it nice to pull away from an intersection without people running under bridges thinking it's an earthquake.  I had to jog back about 3 miles from the repair shop when I dropped it off, which left me semi-crippled since I haven't been doing any running since the fall.  But she's in good shape for the next treks to L.A. and then Flagstaff.
