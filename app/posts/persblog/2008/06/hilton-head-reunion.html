Next stop was a week long family reunion vacation on lovely <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Hilton+Head+Island,+SC&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr">Hilton Head Island, South Carolina</a>.  We rented a fabulous enormous mansion.  We spent our days on the beach, riding bikes, playing golf or tennis, lounging in the pool, and making the periodic Starbucks run.  We also celebrated my father's 60th birthday.  In a fantastic travel-blog synergy, I was able to get Jamie Sue to come out from Manning, SC and spend two days with us, which was a real treat since I haven't seen her since early fall I think.  If you have been reading my blog, you will definitely enjoy her blog of her trip to Buenos Aires and camping in remote Patagonia, Argentina.  I must admit that both her writing and photography are vastly superior to mine, so <a href="http://jamiesue.typepad.com/">check it out</a>
