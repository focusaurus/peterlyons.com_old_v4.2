Well, I can officially say that the green machine has made it all the way across the country.  I started at the Hudson River and made it to the Pacific Ocean.  Saturday night I made it from Portland to the coast in southern Oregon, and Sunday I did the rest of the drive down to the San Francisco bay area.  I took the scenic route along highway 101 for almost the whole way, which is several hours slower than I-5 but a lot more interesting.  I also took a side trip into Humboldt state park to check out the giant Redwood trees.  This week I'm in Sunnyvale for week and I'll be heading down to L.A. on Saturday.
