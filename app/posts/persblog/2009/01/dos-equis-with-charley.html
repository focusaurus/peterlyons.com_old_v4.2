I've only tried about a dozen beers so far and honestly I'm still not that interested.  However, I had a Dos Equis tonight and it was quite delicious.  It's dangerous how much I like Mexican food these days.  I actually tried to get some Thai but I couldn't find one place and the other place seems permanently closed.  Anyway, I'm sitting here stuff full of ski fuel for tomorrow and am quite contented.

At the restaurant I started reading John Steinbeck's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Travels-Charley-Search-America-Steinbeck/dp/0140053204">&quot;Travels with Charley in Search of America&quot;</a>.  You know, between my Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins, they have probably read 50,000 books, yet not one of them recommended this book to me before my trip.  As a matter of fact, I don't know how this ended up on my amazon wishlist, but here I am anyway.  After the first paragraph I was hooked.  Jamie Sue, you must read this immediately.  Here's a line from Part One:

<blockquote>
The techniques of opening conversation are universal.  I knew long ago and rediscovered that the best way to attract attention, help, and conversation is to be lost.  A man who seeing his mother starving to death on a path kicks her in the stomach to clear the way, will cheerfully devote several hours of his time giving wrong directions to a total stranger who claims to be lost.

Winter Park got 11 inches of snow last night.  I'll be there tomorrow to enjoy it.
