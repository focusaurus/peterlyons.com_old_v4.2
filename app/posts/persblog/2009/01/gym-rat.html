I've become a bit of a gym rat this month.  I've been lifting weights and jogging three miles at least every other day.  It's getting to be fun and gives me a chance to load up my mp3 player with lots of hardcore heavy metal/punk type stuff and some techno.

Last weekend I saw some pretty funny short comedy films in Denver at the <a href="http://www.festivusfilmfestival.com/">Festivus Film Festival</a>.  I also just want to state that I am putting forth that <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/episode/season2/episode14.shtml">Six Feet Under</a> Season Two Episode One "In the Game" is the pinnacle of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_comedy">black comdey genre</a>.

We had a great day skiing at Copper Mountain Saturday.  It was quite warm, clear sunny skies, and no wind.  Still plenty of good snow, though.  I must say having the rear bumper of the rogue to sit on while you don your ski boots is far superior to trying this from a sedan.

That's mostly it.  I'm starting to flip through the book "1,000 Recordings To Hear Before You Die", which I bought for myself while Christmas shopping and my mother also ended up getting as a gift for me.  It's nice to go check out their suggestions on Rhapsody.
