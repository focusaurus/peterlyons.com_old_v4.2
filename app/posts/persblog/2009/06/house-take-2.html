Woo hoo! Today I signed a contract to purchase a house!  This time hopefully it goes through.  I'm very excited.  More news on that when things are finalized.  Last Sunday I did a nice hike with CHAOS up Bear Mountain then down Bear Canyon then to Ken's for some grilling and chilling.  I had a few other good social outings this week as well, including Josh & Matt's birthday BBQ.  Tomorrow it's off to the much-anticipated family reunion on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.  In addition to meeting my fresh-from-the-oven nephew Will, I also get to see <a href="http://jamiesue.typepad.com">Jamie Sue</a>.  Can't wait!
