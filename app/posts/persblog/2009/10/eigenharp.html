Slight change of plans today but all for the better. :-) (inside joke).  I got to most of the Developer Day which was cool.  There is a tech startup incubator company called TechStars in downtown Boulder that I wasn't aware of. It is encouraging to know that it is there, though.  I also got to meet <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=beckel">Bruce Eckel</a>, the author of the first ever book on computer programming I used (his Thinking In Java was the text for my now-infamous CS 150 class).  We have a lot in common: java, python, colorado (with the implicit skiing, hiking, mountain biking), and Burning Man, so it was fun to meet him and chat briefly at the happy hour after his talk.  I also went to the Google Boulder office where they were hosting a Python Unconference.  As I said in my facebook status update "The fucking Google Boulder office has a fucking rock climbing wall in the fucking lobby". :-)

I hate emoticons.  I can't believe I used two in this post.
