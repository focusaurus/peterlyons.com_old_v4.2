Did a really fun ride up community ditch->doudy draw->spring brook loop (twice) with a big group of eight riders.  Another fun, short, nearby ride. Hurray!  We finished just before dark and spent the evening at Southern Sun.   This is basically the quintessentially Boulder after work schedule. We were going to do Marshall Mesa but it was blowing strong winds so we opted for something somewhat sheltered.

Making progress on the current project at work, but probably not enough to make the next major release, at least not without some heroics on my part, but I think I still have what it takes to open up the code fire hose full blast.  We'll see.  We haven't yet got the big pieces done to the point where the rest of the system falls into place quickly.  I'm looking forward to some good music and fun this weekend as well.
