This was a very good weekend with a pretty good balance of activities. Friday was a fairly terrible day at work;I was consumed entirely by sideways firefighting and explaining to management that we won't be ready to ship in two months.  After that I went into Boulder to meet up with a friend for my curious obsession: bubble tea.  Thankfully I arrived a few minutes early and could just catch my breath and unwind from work and try to let some of the frustrations go.  It worked well enough that I could enjoy the evening but wasn't really gone yet.  We walked with our Bubble Teas over to Mackey to hear the <a href="http://www.kronosquartet.org">Kronos Quartet</a> play a concert of contemporary music.  I really enjoyed all the pieces.  They also did their signature piece: George Crumb's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Angels_(Crumb)">Black Angels</a>, which I also enjoyed hearing live.  I rounded out the night with some buffalo wings, which I had a strange craving for.

Saturday during the day I exercised with yoga, weights, and swimming.  I set another personal best: 65 laps, which is about two miles.  It took me about an hour and a half or so which is about four different lifeguard shifts, apparently.  Then I went to a party with Erin thrown for a bunch of her friends/family celebrating three concurrent pregnancies in their core group.  Afterward we went to hear <a href="http://www.galacticfunk.com/">Galactic</a> at the Fox Theater, which was a pretty good show and enthusiastically received by the Boulder crowd.  The covered a <a href="http://www.balkanbeatbox.com/">Balkan Beat Box</a> tune, which is unbelievably hip, and their drummer is the amazing <a href="http://www.stantonmoore.com/">Stanton Moore</a>.

Today it's mostly working from home on a Sunday, but I'm making some good progress which has been long awaited.  Lots more good stuff in store for October.
