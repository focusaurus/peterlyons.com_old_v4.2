Did another nice full moon hike with Mags and Chaos Monday night.  We went up Sanitas on a cold and misty night under some hazy clouds.  There was still ample light on the trail.  I had never actually hiked Sanitas, the most popular trail in Boulder, so it was good to get that done.  I baked some banana bread for the hike which I think came out great.  Yesterday I was working up at Fort Collins since HP had a big town hall meeting.  They gave us New Belgium beers (brewery is in Fort Collins), hurray!
