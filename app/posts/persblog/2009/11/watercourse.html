I had a very good week and weekend this week.  I went bouldering Wednesday and top rope climbing Thursday.  Both were good sessions but I'm in need of a few days rest for sure.  I have a new pull up bar in the yoga room so I was messing around with that as well.  Saturday I did some nice yoga and went for a run.  Then I headed in to Denver to help Michale get a couch into her apartment.  We had a fantastic meal at <a href="http://www.watercoursefoods.com/">Watercourse</a>, a really cool vegan restaurant.  It was delicious.  I had polenta with cashew butter, carrots, beats, and grilled tofu.  When we were done I wanted to eat it again.  We also got two delicious desserts to go.  After a brief tour through the Tattered Cover book store we headed home to lounge on the couch with our decadent vegan cake.  It was heavenly.
