It's 90 degrees here today and I'm still pretty comfortable.  I _might_ bust out the A/C.  It's pretty nice.  When it's 90 in Jersey you are soaked in sweat in 10 minutes if you walk outside.  Sadly some wrist pain is coming back again that I have gotten in the past when working at a desk that is too high.  I'm taking some restorative measures, but I'll still have to wait a while for my <a href="http://www.geekdesk.com">GeekDesk</a> to arrive.
