I worked a bit in the peace and quiet of the holiday on Friday, which was nice.  In the evening Erin and I walked in to old town Louisville to meet up with <a href="http://weiskind.livejournal.com">weiskind</a> and <a href="http://rayhawk.livejournal.com">rayhawk</a> for dinner and drinks. We had a few laughs at Empire diner with regard to accidentally making out with the bar tender.

Saturday was my personal economic stimulus plan.  I hit four garage sales before 9am and scored some great patio furniture dirt cheap plus some other assorted sundries (free stapler!).  Then I did a bunch more shopping all over the place for various little items for the house.  In the evening I caught the last bit of a trivial pursuit game (25th Anniversary Edition) at the Pizzi's then went with Erin to watch the fireworks at the CU football stadium.  That ended up being a lot of fun.  The crowd was throwing paper airplanes all over the place, and the fireworks were basically right in front of our faces.  After that we tooled around town a bit on bikes and stopped at Haagen-Dazs for the first ice cream I have eaten since November.  Mmm....coffee mocha chip.
