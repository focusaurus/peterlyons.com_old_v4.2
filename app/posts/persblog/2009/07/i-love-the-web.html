I bought some corn at the Boulder Farmer's Market.  I haven't cooked this myself before, and I knew it was fairly self-explanatory, but I just wanted to do a quick google - just in case.  I found <a href="http://www.cornonthecobrecipe.com/boiled-corn-on-the-cob/">this page</a>.  This could not be more exactly what I want.  Picture by picture.  Tiny text annotations. Not even full sentences. Informative but just tiny hints of personality. No ads. No terrible layout with big div tags of links everywhere.  Old school. So good.
