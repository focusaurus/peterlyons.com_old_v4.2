I have it! Imogen Heap's new album is out and I own a physical copy.  However, I'm exercising delayed gratification and won't listen to it until I'm on a nice long stretch of highway on the drive out to Burning Man on Sunday.  Speaking of which, I bought a funny BMX dirt bike for the burn that is probably going to be a lot of fun to ride around on and do wheelies.  It has pegs!

In more serious cycling news, tonight I biked Betasso Pass with Erin.  That thing is pretty much God's gift to the intermediate mountain bike rider.  Really fun. It's a short loop, so we did it twice.
