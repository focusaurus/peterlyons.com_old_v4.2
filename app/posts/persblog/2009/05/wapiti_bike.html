Sunday I hiked the <a href="http://www.protrails.com/trail.php?trailID=4">Wapiti Trail</a> up in Heil Valley just north of town with a group of eight from my hiking club.  It was a really nice hike and a very friendly group.  Very easy hiking but great mountain views.  Next weekend I'm going to go back and bike it, which should be fun.
