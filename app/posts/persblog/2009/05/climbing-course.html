Today I went up to Estes Park and took the <a href="http://www.totalclimbing.com">Colorado Mountain School's</a> into to outdoor rock climbing course.  It's an all day course and there were just two students registered, so it was basically like an all day private lesson with a professional guide.  I learned lots of good stuff, including how to repel, which I have been wanting to learn for a while.  We did quite a good number of fun short climbing routes as well.  The weather was mostly good with the exception of a brief rain and thunder storm in the afternoon.
