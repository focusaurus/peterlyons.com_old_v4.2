When I read articles like <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/09/03/how-to-get-people-to-reply-to-your-messages-in-online-dating-part-i/">this one from the OK Cupid blog</a>, they always post some complete jack-ass messages sent by guys on their site.  It makes me sad for the recipients of said messages and frustrated because my own messages have to be mixed with theirs.  I really wish that there was a "flag as jerk" button recipients could hit and we could just weed these morons out and get on with it.
