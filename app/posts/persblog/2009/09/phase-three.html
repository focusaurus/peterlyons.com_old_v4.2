Today I'm going to the next level.  I've got a big project at work that has the potential for either great success or great failure, but I'm firing on all cylinders to make it my best work to date, and I'm locking in on a steady state of daily optimal performance and creativity. I'm also at a good point now to refocus and rededicate myself across the board.  Here are my goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Peak performance at work</li>
<li>More love</li>
<li>More effective exercise</li>
<li>Better diet/nutrition</li>
<li>More yoga</li>
<li>More music</li>
<li>More reading</li>
</ul>
<p>
Today I will consider all these things, make my trade-offs, priorities, and commitments, and start making it happen each day.  It's going to be a great day and only get better from here.
