Had a fun weekend last weekend even though Michale was visiting Seattle.  Saturday I had some yummy tamales and wood fired pizza at the Boulder Farmer's Market.  Then I holed up in The Cup for some mind mapping and planning stuff over a giant mocha milkshake.  Then I headed up Flagstaff Road and did the Meyers Homestead trail on my mountain bike.  In the evening I joined Stephanie and some friends for Top Gun at Boulder Outdoor Cinema, with some game-playing beforehand.  Sunday I did some computer work at home in the morning and then road Dowdy Draw/Spring Brook Loop with Erin.  Then off to Denver to see a live performance of Hedwig and the Angry Inch at the Avenue Theatre.  It was overall very well-performed and enjoyable.  Afterward we got dinner at Steubens.

Uck. Last night was my worst performance at Climb Fit class yet.  I'm not sure what happened.  I did OK on the first 2 laps then faded very quickly and by the fifth lap I was "pumped out of my tree" as the instructor likes to say. The tops of my forearms are sore these days from computer RSI all day.  After class the bottoms of my forearms were aching relentlessly.  I'm not sure what that's about but it was frustrating.

Tonight Michale came home and we went to the first half of <a href="http://ignitedenver.org">Ignite Denver</a>  which was some good people/hipster watching combined with some so-so presentations.  Tomorrow I'm off to Vermont for vacation and reunion with the Lyons side of the family!
