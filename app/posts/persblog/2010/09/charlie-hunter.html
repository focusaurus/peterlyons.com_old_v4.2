Saw <a href="http://www.charliehunter.com">Charlie Hunter</a> tonight at the Fox Theatre in Boulder.  He had Mike Williams playing bass trumpet.  I've seen a lot of strange instruments, so it's pretty rare for me to hear something new, but I can honestly say I had never heard a bass trumpet.  I could tell it was bigger than a flugelhorn though.  The drummer Eric Kalb was sounding very good, but overall I didn't like the show very much.  Mike played a lot of quasi-random isolated notes and flubs and was short on lyrical lines.
