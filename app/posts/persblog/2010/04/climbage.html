Had a great climbing coaching session with <a href="http://www.totalclimbing.com/page.php?pname=training/personal">Chris Wall</a> this morning.  Did laps leading a 5.10 route.  On the third lap, I was pretty sure there was no chance of getting to the top, but I surprised myself.  I made the first four clips pretty easily and when I got to the last big jug before the push to the anchor I was like "I've got enough left to do this".  I relaxed and did it and it felt really great.  I listened to some fantastic <a href="http://www.sfjazz.org/SFJAZZCollective/2010/index.asp">San Francisco Jazz Collective</a> on the way home with great vibes and marimba.  I don't know why these awesome instruments aren't used more regularly.  We need to hear a lot more vibes, marimba, bass clarinet, french horn, and trombone.
