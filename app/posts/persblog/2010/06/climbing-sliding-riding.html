Just a quick update on what I've been up to.  Finally got over to <a href="http://www.thespotgym.com/">The Spot</a> last Thursday to boulder on their newly-added wall.  It's a nice addition. Friday I lifted weights at BRC, which made me still a bit sore for climbing outdoors on Saturday.  We went up Boulder Canyon with a fairly large group to Avalon.  I got to cross the creek doing my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrolean_traverse">Tyrolean Traverse</a>, which was mildly thrilling (?).  We did a bunch of climbing and I think I climbed my favorite outdoor route so far.

After climbing I met up with Michale and her friend Cecilia who was in town.  We wondered around the Pearl St mall a bit and eventually headed home for a nice meal with broiled salmon and some good veggies.  Of course we played some Guitar Hero as well.

Sunday we had a big pancake breakfast and then had a lovely drive out to Golden to hit the <a href="http://www.heritagesquarealpineslide.com/">Heritage Square Alpine Slide</a>.  It was pretty fun, you get a really nice view of the whole surrounding area from the ski lift that takes you to the top, and it's just $7, so overall worthwhile if you're passing through.  Then we headed back to Boulder, grabbed some loaner bicycles and some eats, and then headed over to Scott Carpenter Park for the <a href="http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5152&Itemid=1189">B360 Bike Ride</a>.  We had fun riding all around Boulder with a big crowd and lots of free yummies from vendors at the end.

Finally got back to the Level 2 Group Fitness class at BRC last night and then rested for an hour before my climbing partner arrived for another ninety plus minutes of climbing.  Next up is a highly anticipated <a href="http://imogenheap.com/">Imogen Heap</a> concert on Friday in Denver, and then Saturday morning it's off to Hilton Head for the Pizzi family reunion!
