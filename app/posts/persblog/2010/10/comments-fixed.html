For a while it seems my anti-spam system for blog comments was misconfigured and holding comments in a quarantine without telling me.  This has been corrected.  All comments that were trapped in the void are now posted live on the site.  The anti-spam setup has been fixed so this shouldn't happen again.  No comments that were submitted have been lost.  Sorry for that technical glitch.  Ditto applies to my professional blog.
