It's been a good week.  Went to a fun CHAOS pot luck on Thursday and really enjoyed the long weekend. I went to the Avery Brewery on Friday with Josh and Elise and heard some good bluegrass by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Longest-Day-Of-The-Year/81341633811?v=app_2405167945">The Longest Day of the Year</a>.  Afterward I went and worked out at BRC, which is open to 11pm on Fridays, which rocks.  I rested about twelve hours before climbing again on Saturday at The Spot. On Sunday, Michale treated me to delicious breakfast at <a href="http://www.watercoursefoods.com/">Watercourse</a>, which I devoured. I also brought home a sweet potato cinnamon roll for later. Michale and I had a blast playing Guitar Hero World Tour for hours on end both Saturday and Sunday night.  So much fun.
