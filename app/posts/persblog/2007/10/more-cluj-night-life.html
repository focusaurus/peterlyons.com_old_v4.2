My first Friday in Cluj I went out with Horatiu to some local bars.&nbsp; We first tried Janis Pub, which was having some live music as part of the <a href="http://www.transilvaniajazzfestival.ro/">Transilvania Jazz Festival</a> .&nbsp; However, the solo piano was either horribly amplified or it was an electric piano, so we moved on to a bar called Fire.&nbsp; This was the more dive bar punk rock scene.&nbsp; We hung out there most of the night.&nbsp; The crowd here was certainly more diverse and interesting than in the clubs.&nbsp; Many of the girls seem to cut their hair by jumping on a trampoline below a sharp ceiling fan, though.&nbsp; There was a small non-smoking section through a corridor, which was completely blocked with smokers taunting anyone who attempted to go in there.

When someone puked and the crowd around him took no notice of it, I glanced at Horatiu, and he said right away "it happens".&nbsp; I decided to head out at that point.
