So unfortunately I have come down with a cold.&nbsp; I should probably chalk it up to working late during the week.&nbsp; In any case, Friday I had the worst sore throat I can remember, so I stayed in the hotel and rested.&nbsp; I also had to skip out on today's road trip to Brasov, sadly.&nbsp; I'm in the hotel now trying to rest and feel better and take care of some work things.&nbsp;
