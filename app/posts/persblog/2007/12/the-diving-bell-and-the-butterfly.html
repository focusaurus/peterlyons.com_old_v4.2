When I returned to Santa Fe there was a dusting of snow on the ground and it stayed around most of the week as the temperatures were consistently low.&nbsp; Finally Thursday and Friday it warmed back up into the forties.&nbsp; This week was bad as far as work goes.&nbsp; We completed primary coding on this release back in July and with the exception of a six-week stint on the next release, it's been pretty much nothing but bug fixing since then and it's really starting to wear on me.

In other news, I think I've secured a great home to rent in Boulder, Colorado next month.&nbsp; There is a mind boggling series of logistics to get everything to fall into place, but hopefully all will work out.&nbsp; According to Plan A (I have A-E or so), I'll be back "home" in Hoboken Dec 17-31.&nbsp; If all goes according to plan we'll have a new tenant to take over by then and I can fully move out.

Tonight I went to see the film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly_%28film%29">The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a> that is playing here as part of the<a href="http://www.santafefilmfestival.com"> Santa Fe Film Festival</a>.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I've never cried so consistently throughout a movie.&nbsp; It was very touching a powerful.&nbsp; Definitely recommended.
