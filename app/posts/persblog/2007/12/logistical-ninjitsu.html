It's "O Dark Thirty" here in Santa Fe as my parents' friend often says harking back to his West Point days.&nbsp; In a moment I'll put the rest of my stuff into the green machine and head up to Boulder, Colorado.&nbsp; I've certainly enjoyed the stay here.&nbsp; The house was perfect.&nbsp; I don't think the town is a good match for me long term.&nbsp; I'm still adjusting to non-NYC realities. In Santa Fe, in 6 months I would have eaten at every restaurant in town.&nbsp; I guess it's hard to concretize the fact that NYC is around 114 times bigger. :-)

Anyway, I had a funny moment yesterday as I was packing up the car.&nbsp; An older gentleman across the street hollered out "What part of New Jersey are you from?".&nbsp; After a brief exchange, it turns out we both went to Cranford High School and grew up in the small town of Cranford, NJ.&nbsp; He was class of 1957 or thereabouts and I'm 1997.

So the good news is that barring any credit check failures I've found a new tenant for my Hoboken apartment, which means I can move out fully at the end of this month and be done with the lease.&nbsp; That will simplify things a lot.&nbsp; And this was all done remotely over <a href="http://craigslist.org">craigslist </a>with some cooperation from my current subtenant, so that's a big relief.&nbsp; It also means I don't have to flyback again at the end of February just to move out.

Anyway, logistics indicate I finish packing up and hit the road ASAP, so happy holidays, folks!
