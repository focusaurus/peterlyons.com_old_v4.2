OK, I've finally caught up on posting photos.
</p>
<p>
First, from the Romania trip, I only posted selected photos to this blog. For all of them see <a href="/app/photos?gallery=romania_2007">my photos from Romania</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then, photos from <a href="/app/photos?gallery=halloween_2007">Thorp's Halloween pumpkin carving party</a>.
</p>
<p>
A few shots from my <a href="/app/photos?gallery=cross_country_drive_2007">cross country road trip</a>.
</p>
<p>
And the first bunch of photos from <a href="/app/photos?gallery=santa_fe_2007">my stay in Santa Fe.</a> 
</p>
<p>
Today I went to a rock climbing contest (amateur - just for fun) at the Santa Fe Climbing Club and watched for a while.&nbsp; Then I visited the <a href="http://www.internationalfolkart.org/">Museum of International Folk Art</a>, which had a very cool exhibit of quilts from <a href="http://www.quiltsofgeesbend.com/">Gee's Bend</a>, Alabama.&nbsp; Then I did another walk around the main square.
