Well, when I finally got fed up with how apartment living in NYC cramped my musical style, I moved out to Colorado and bought a house with a big basement to use as a music studio.  Today for the first time it was put to good use.  I had a 7-piece Afrobeat band rehearsing this evening as well as a duet rehearsal this afternoon for a total of about 5 hours of rehearsal today.  The space is working out nicely.  I even ran outside for a quick loudness check.  You can definitely hear the band from the sidewalk but it's not loud enough to cause any complaints, so I think we're clear to rehearse whenever we want as long as we want. Hurray!
