I'm in San Francisco this weekend.  Staying in rooms rented via <a href="http://airbnb.com">airbnb</a>.  So far so good this morning.  I walked to Sunrise restaurant in The Mission for poached eggs with avocado, bacon, and spinach on English muffin.  Yum.  Then I hit Mission Cliffs for some exercise and bouldering.  Stopped home for a shower and a nap and now I'm off to explore around and find some yummy lunch.
