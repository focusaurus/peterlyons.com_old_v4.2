I've had four days of independence so far and it is going great.  Today I practiced both baritone and alto sax, read about javascript and LLCs, added a new feature to <a href="https://linkzie.com">Linkzie</a>, wrote a bit on the white paper I'm writing, ate a ton of calories as part of my weekly "cheat day", checked references for a new personal assistant, and am now watching some movies.  If things continue this way of easy motivation, it will be really fun.
