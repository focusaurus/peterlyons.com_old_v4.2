Having a damn fine weekend in Louisville.  Friday I went to Oktoberfest downtown at the pavilion with a new friend Brenda.  We drank Oskar Blues beers and had some street food while listening to the polka band and chatting up the locals.  Today I ran a bunch of errands and had a yummy panera bread sandwich and some cinnamon crumb cake.  Tonight I went back into downtown Louisville to enjoy the [Gora Gora Orkestar](http://www.reverbnation.com/goragoraorkestar).  I sat in a bit for their second set, which was fun.  They played the Star Wars Cantina song and some great 7/8 beats.  I think Smithwick's is poised to become my favorite beer.  It's really good.
