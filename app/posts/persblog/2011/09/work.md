So it's been almost 8 months since I quit my job at HP.  I prefer being retired and hope to return to that disposition as soon as possible. But, alas, next week I return to the world of wage-earners.  It took a long time and a lot of flip-flopping to decide between two opportunities, but I've decided to join a Boulder based development shop called [Dojo4](http://dojo4.com).  I was also considered a Boulder TechStars startup, but ultimately decided I'm not ready to dive into a startup right now.

Hung out with Julia last night.  We tried the new rooftop bar at the Rex in downtown Louisville.  Nice locale.  Menu has variety but otherwise follows the Applebees/TGI Friday model.  Today I went to the farmer's market and then hiked Rabbit Mountain.
