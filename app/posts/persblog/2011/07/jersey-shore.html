I spent yesterday on the beach with the Skareckis.  The water was warm and nice with fun little waves.  We had a nice Cuban sandwich on the boardwalk for lunch and relaxed on the beach.  Sunny Daze had a gig right on the boardwalk that evening.  They are sounding great these days and they have three killer horns (trombone, tenor, alto).  They have been writing a whole bunch of new tunes, but they threw me a couple of old familiar tunes so I could jam with them a bit.  After the second set I had some yummy ribs and sweet potato fries on the boardwalk followed by a gigantic cookies and cream milkshake.  We hung out and talked a while and then headed over to their main hangout, the Nip and Tuck, for their standard nightcap of chicken wings.  I stayed over at Marc's new house in Fair Haven.

Now I'm down in Seaside Park with my family for the week.  Should be a bunch of good relaxing and good eating.
