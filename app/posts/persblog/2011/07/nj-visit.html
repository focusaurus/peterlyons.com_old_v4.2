So I'm going back to New Jersey for a nice long visit at the end of July.  I'll be doing a brief NYC visit, spending some time down the shore with my family and my new nephew Danny, and relaxing in Lambertville a bit as well.  We'll also have our multi-birthday party, July edition with the Pizzi clan, which will be fun.  I'm looking forward to hanging out at the beach with my old Sunny Daze buddies.  Even though I've been back to visit a few times, I still feel like I haven't hung out with that crew properly since I moved in 2007.
