<a href="http://afronautsband.com">The Afronauts</a> had our first performance in Boulder Wednesday night.  We played the Laughing Goat Coffeehouse on Pearl St.  It was a big success.  The band that played before us, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/backtothewoods">Back to the Woods</a> played a great set and the audience was in good spirits.  We crammed almost the entire band onto the small corner stage.  The attendance was great.  The place was nearly packed, and there was a very small space for dancing up front.  We heard a lot of positive feedback and in general folks seemed to really be digging the music and the vibe.  Stephen and I did our first dueling baritone saxophone duet, which went over really well.  We're trying to book another night there later this summer, so stay tuned for updates.

Last night I drove up to Longmont to sit in with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gora-Gora-Orkestar/109623152388928">Gora Gora Orkestar</a> at a fundraiser at the Left Hand Brewery.  They are a really fun and vibrant group.  What's not to love about odd meters, sousaphone bass, and flat-two scales?
