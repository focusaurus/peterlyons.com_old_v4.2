Dear Universe,
</p>
<p>
   Please manifest a way for me to specify that my key browser keyboard shortcuts will work even when I'm watching a flash video.  Specifically I always want "close window", "new tab", and "cycle active window" to work.  I hate that after watching a video I have to click on the surrounding non-flash web page to get my keyboard commands working again. Please post a comment on this blog post when you are done manifesting this.

Thanks,
</p>
<p>
Pete
