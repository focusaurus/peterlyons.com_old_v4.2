So I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.sonos.com">Sonos</a> music systems, but they've always been expensive.  Almost prohibitively so.  But now I can either spend <a href="http://sonos.com/products/controllers/cr200/default.aspx?rdr=true&LangType=1033">$349</a> for an additional controller that controls my sonos and does precisely fuck-all else, or I can buy an iPod Touch on <a href="http://boulder.craigslist.org">craigslist</a> for $125 and then download the free Sonos controller application, plus do all the other iPod Touch stuff.  I'm not sure who Sonos thinks is going to buy this thing anymore other than the utterly rich and utterly clueless.
