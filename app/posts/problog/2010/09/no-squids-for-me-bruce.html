<a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> is a leading author in the technology security and cryptography fields.  He is exceedingly rational and pragmatic.  I consider his insights on dealing with terrorism to be bar none the best available.  His blog often has great insights.  However, for reasons I can't understand, he always posts a random post on Fridays about squids.  Yes, the sea creature.  I don't know why, but it stopped being cute long ago.

To that end, I've created a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/peterlyons/schneiernosquids">Yahoo Pipe Feed of the Schneier on Security blog with the Friday Squid Blogging filtered out</a>.  Feel free to subscribe and enjoy.
