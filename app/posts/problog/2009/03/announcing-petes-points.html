I have decided to start a "professional" blog.  I use the word "professional" only in the sense of "not personal".  I will post about software engineering, computers, consumer electronics, and music technology primarily.  You may want to read this  <a href="/problog/about/">description of what this blog is all about</a>.  I hope you enjoy it and look forward to any conversations this generates.
