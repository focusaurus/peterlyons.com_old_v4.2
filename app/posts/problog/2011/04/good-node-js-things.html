I hope to post some details on this soon, but just a note that my ongoing node.js hacking is turning up some real gems.  I migrated my application level tests from Zombie to Phantom with great results.  phantom.js is pretty rad.  Also got remote graphical debugging in the browser working and learned how to properly drop in a REPL for quick and dirty investigations, which is cool.  Maybe on Thursday I'll have time to post some of the details, but at this point my node.js stack is pretty fierce.
