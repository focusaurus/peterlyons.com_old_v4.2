Just a quick note that I'm off to <a href="http://www.microconf.com">MicroConf</a> in Las Vegas tomorrow.  A buddy of mine from Denver Hack Nite is also going.  It should be a really fun time and hopefully I'll learn a lot.  I've been coding away like a madman (an excruciating 4-6 hours a day!) preparing a little proof-of-concept for the startup idea I'm working on.  Can't wait to have it scutinized and hopefully not completely blasted to bits.  I'll be blogging and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/focusaurus">tweeting</a> if there's anything interesting and I'm not too busy concentrating.
