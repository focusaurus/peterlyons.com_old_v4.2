I have added a bookmarklet feature to <a href="https://linkzie.com">Linkzie</a>.  In the "organize your links" area you will see a little link there you can drag to your browser's bookmarks bar.  Then if you are looking at a web page and want to save it into Linkzie, just click the bookmarklet.  You will be able to set the name and category for the link and then be taken right back to the original page you were looking at.  This should make it easier to get lots of links into Linkzie.  Enjoy!
