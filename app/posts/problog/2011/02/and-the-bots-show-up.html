I set up a staging server for a web app I'm working on yesterday.  This morning I find this in my rails log.

<div class="code">
<pre>
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/scripts/setup.php"):
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/sql/scripts/setup.php"):
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/web/scripts/setup.php"):
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/scripts/setup.php"):
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/admin/scripts/setup.php"):
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/PMA/scripts/setup.php"):
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/phpmyadmin/scripts/setup.php"):
</pre>
</div>

Thus the shotgun bot scanning has commenced.  It's funny how organic and viral (viral in the bad sense) the web is given it's all just computer programs.
