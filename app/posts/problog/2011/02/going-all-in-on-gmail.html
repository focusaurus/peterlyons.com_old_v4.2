So somewhere in college around 2000 I started running my own IMAP mail server and storing my own mail.  Around 2007 I got tired of fighting the spam battle and switched to gmail.  I migrated some of my current messages into gmail using IMAP, but I didn't want to dump everything in there.  Today I realized I no longer have convenient access to those messages sitting in mbox format files on the linux laptop I rarely use anymore, so I hooked Thunderbird up to gmail and dragged my mail archives into gmail.  That was about 12,000 messages between 2000 and 2007.  Now it's all in one happy, searchable, spam-free place.  As long as Google doesn't spontaneously disappear gmail, I should be in good shape.
