As you may notice, the <a href="/">peterlyons.com</a> site has been redesigned.  I worked with <a href="http://stephaniehenderson.com">Stephanie Henderson</a> to get a new look now that I am an independent professional.  I'm pleased with the results, and the blogs are more seamlessly integrated now.

I have also released a new version of <a href="https://linkzie.com">Linkzie</a> today featuring a brand new web design. The original layout of categories was based on rows and that has been changed to columns.  Check it out!
