I got to participate in a cool new brainstorming event called <a href="http://houseofgenius.org">House of Genius</a> last night.  I won't say too much about it since the founders seem to prefer if the participants don't know exactly what to expect.  But it was populated by a great group of smart and interesting people from many different age groups and backgrounds.  It was in a super-swank enormous apartment downtown and was overall very unusual, engaging, and fun.  It's funny, last week's Denver Hack Nite meetup was also in an inappropriately-fancy mansion.  Maybe all my tech meetups will gradually start shifting from coffee shops and garages to luxury homes with helipads....
