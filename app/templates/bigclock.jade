  BigClock is a simple desktop clock utility that fills up the entire
  window with a clock, so you can get a clock of any size. It allows you
  to choose your own colors and time format.
  You can launch it through Java Web Start with the
  link below, or [download the jar file directly](./dist/bigclock.jar)
  and run it with the command 'java -jar bigclock.jar'
  using JRE 1.3 or newer.
