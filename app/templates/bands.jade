  I played in from 2001-2007. The band continues to perform around the
  Jersey shore scene. During my tenure, we recorded three CDs. You can

  I also used to perform with a great soul/funk band called
  [Confunktion Junction](http://cdbaby.com/cd/confunktion).
  I joined in October 2002 and the band fizzled out in early 2007.
  We recorded an EP of our original material.
