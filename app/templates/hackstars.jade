  **Hey, TechStars!** My name is Pete, I am a huge fan, and I want to be
  a HackStar this summer in Boulder. I've got the start-up bug and want to
  sling some code for this summer's companies.
  How bad do I have the start-up bug?

  Well, I recently quit my job as a software engineer at HP to free myself up
  for start-up action, and I'd like to bring a company of my own through the
  TechStars program someday soon. In the meantime, I'd like to become a HackStar
  and help start-ups hit it out of the park TechStars style.

  **What is Pete bringing to the program?**

  * 10 years experience doing enterprise back-ends and web development
  * A commitment to code quality, agile development, and test driven development
