  I built a web application for managing lots of bookmarks. It's up over at
  <a target="_blank" href="https://linkzie.com/">linkzie.com</a>.
  The original idea
  came from a little python script I built way back in 2004 that would generate
  a page similar to linkzie, albeit a very crude version initially. All the data
  was manually edited into the script by hand and then the script could
  regenerate a new HTML page. Linkzie has now been made into a modern multi-user
  web application with easy drag-n-drop organization and a nice single page
  application AJAX user experience. There's more information on the Linkzie
  site, so please go check it out.
