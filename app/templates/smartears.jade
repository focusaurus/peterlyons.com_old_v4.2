  | Check out my ear training program (Summer 2001).  This program
  | will help you quickly learn to recognize and identify common musical
  | structures including intervals, scales/modes, and chords.

  | My java friends who don't want to mess around with Java Web Start can
  | download <a href="/dist/smartears.jar">smartears.jar</a> and launch the
  | application by typing:
  | 
  | <code>java -jar SmartEars.jar</code>
  | 
  | Using SmartEars should be (I hope!) largely self-explanatory and easy.
  | Two quick tips:
  | * To turn off certain answers you are not intrested in 
  |     (eg. unisons and octaves) right-click on their button (Command-click on OS X)
  | * To hear sounds played simultaneously (as a chord) instead of arpeggiated,
  |     click into the Settings Tab and set the Note Delay to 0
