Thanks for visiting my web site.  Here you will find some music, some
software, and some photographs. I used to try to update this page with
news at least a few times a year, but lately I've been too busy and
have decided just to link you to the web sites for my bands.

I perform publicly with two great bands. <a
href="http://www.sunnydaze.ws">Sunny Daze</a> is my six piece Acid
Jazz/Funk/Latin band.  
<a href="http://www.confunktionjunction.com">Confunktion Junction</a>
is my Soul/Funk/R&B band that plays originals and cover tunes. To see
when my next performance will be, click <a

Daze and <a
