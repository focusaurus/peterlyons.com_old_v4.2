Thanks for visiting peterlyons.com. Lots has been going on
recently. My musical activities have expanded to include three groups.
There's <a href="http://www.sunnydaze.ws">Sunny Daze</a>, the six piece
acid-jazz/latin/funk group that I have been playing with since June
2001.  I've also got a new jazz quartet called Deftet with Joe P and
Matt from Sunny Daze as well as our great guitar player Nick.  We play
every Friday night at the Millenium Restaurant on Woodbridge Ave in
Edison, NJ from 9-12.  Finally, I just recently joined a great funk
band, <a href="http://www.confunktionjunction.com">Confunktion
Junction</a>.  We play some originals as well as covers of Kool &amp;
the Gang, James Brown, and others.  I played my first live show with
them Oct 26 at the Acme Underground, and it was a good set.

In other news, I'll be starting a new job as a Senior Programmer with
<a href="http://careers3.accenture.com/xd/tsWeb/main.asp">Accenture
Technology Soulutions</a> on November 4, which I am very excited
about.  I'll also be moving to a new apartment for December.
