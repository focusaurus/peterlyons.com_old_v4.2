Many of them
have been treasured for years. Some have recently been stuck as my "go to"
album where I just want to play their album on a continuous loop for a month
or so.</p>

<h3>Bobby McFerrin</h3>

<p>Bobby is one of my true idols. He&#39;s a brilliant musician. Of course the
general public will always associate him with his unexpected pop radio hit
from the 80s, but he is a musician of the highest caliber with an extensive
career. His jazz, classical, and "crossover" recordings are a thing of rare
beauty. I like pretty much all of his recordings, but in particular I
recommend you listen to the following.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://store.bobbymcferrin.com/papermusic.html">Paper Music</a>. This is a classical recording with Bobby conducting and singing on some tracks. Listen to the Tchaikovsky <strong>Andante Cantabile</strong>. This recording is otherworldly in its grace and elegance. At the end you are compelled to fall to your knees and weep. </li>
<li><a href="http://store.bobbymcferrin.com/beyondwords.html">Beyond Words</a> is a great recording of Bobby&#39;s specialty vocals. You will find "Invocation" sampled on some pop and hip-hop tracks these days as well. </li>
<li><a href="http://store.bobbymcferrin.com/medicinemusic.html">Medicine Music</a> has great, fun songs, especially <strong>Baby</strong>, and <a href="http://store.bobbymcferrin.com/circlesongs.html">Circlesongs</a> is great for meditation, yoga, and relaxation. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Queen</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been hopelessly obsessed with Queen ever since their Wayne&#39;s World
revival. I love the orchestral and progressive nature of their sound. Freddie
and Brian in particular are pure genius. Most of it is just great sounding fun
entertaining music, but I find both <strong>Tenement Fuster</strong> and <strong>39</strong> to be works
of art in the first class.</p>

<h3>Wynton Marsalis</h3>

<p>I find Wynton&#39;s role as ambassador very inspiring. He&#39;s a great virtuouso,
composer, and figurehead. I never hear much talk about <a href="http://www.wyntonmarsalis.org/discography/jazz/blood-on-the-fields/">Blood on the
Fields</a>, but I consider it to be a consummate masterpiece of long-form jazz
composition. If you haven&#39;t heard it, and have a long airplane ride coming up,
set aside some focused time to check it out. It&#39;s 3 CDs long though, but
there&#39;s amazing writing, playing, and singing in there.</p>

<h3>Steve Reich</h3>

<p>Largely thanks to <a href="/problog/2009/03/music-subscription-and-rhapsody/">Rhapsody</a>, I&#39;ve become a big Steve Reich fan. I listened
to a box set of 30 years of his work while coding and got hooked. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000005J4P/howardstokarmana">Works:
1965-1995</a> is a great collection. My favorite is the slow movement from
<strong>Electric Counterpoint</strong>, which is stunningly beautiful.</p>

<h3>Philip Glass</h3>

<p>Another great minimalist classical composer, Philip Glass has a great
aesthetic. His music is great for coding and he has written several gorgeous
film scores.</p>

<h3>Imogen Heap</h3>

<p>What&#39;s not to love about this charming Brit? Her work on Frou Frou
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Details-Frou/dp/B00006EXLQ/ref=pd_sim_m_4">Details</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Speak-Yourself-Imogen-Heap/dp/B000B7BZM4">Speak for Yourself</a> is fantastic. I got to see her on the
last US tour for Ellipse, which was fun. She&#39;s a great character and has a
great aesthetic. Her big hit <strong>Hide and Seek</strong> is haunting. She&#39;s pretty much
the queen of audience connection and is paving new paths there pulling content
from her fans.</p>

<h3>Zoe Keating</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.zoekeating.com/">Zoe</a> is a cellist who creates overdubbed loops of her cello in real time.
Her music is really unique and beautiful. She&#39;s one of my main inspirations to
get my Eigenharp. Got to see her when she came to Chautauqua.</p>
