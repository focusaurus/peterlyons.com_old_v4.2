Thanks for visiting my web site.  Here you will find links to my blogs above, some music, some
software, some articles, and some photographs.

<a
href="http://www.sunnydaze.ws">Sunny Daze</a> is the Acid
Jazz/Funk/Latin band I played in from 2001-2007. The band in that formation is no longer active due to relocations and babies.
Please check out the web site for our albums, sound clips, photos, and info.

I also used to perform with a great soul/funk band called <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/confunktion">Confunktion Junction</a>.  I joined in October 2002 and the band fizzled out in early 2007.
