<b>Hey, TechStars!</b> My name is Pete, I am a huge fan, and I want to be a Summer Associate. I've got the start-up bug and want to get involved. How bad do I have the start-up bug?
</p>
<p>
Well, I recently quit my job as a software engineer at HP to free myself up for start-up action, and I'd like to bring a company of my own through the TechStars program someday soon. In the meantime, I'd like to become a Summer Associate and help start-ups hit it out of the park TechStars style.
</p>

<b>Why is Pete going to crush this position?</b>
<ul>
  <li>He is "all in" in startup mode</li>
  <li>He is passionate about entrepreneurship and loves the vibrant community we have here in Boulder, with TechStars at the epicenter.</li>
  <li>He has a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> addiction (but it's under control)</li>
  <li>He is smart and gets things done</li>
  <li>He has read <a href="http://www.domorefasterbook.com/">Do More Faster</a>, <a href="http://www.startupbook.net/">Start Small, Stay Small</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a>, <a href="http://codersatwork.com/">Coders at Work</a>, and lots of other books and blogs in that vein.
</ul>
