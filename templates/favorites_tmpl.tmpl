Below is a list of musicians who have had a lasting impact on me. Many of them have been treasured for years.  Some have recently been stuck as my "go to" album where I just want to play their album on a continuous loop for a month or so.
</p>
<h3>Bobby McFerrin</h3>
<p>
Bobby is one of my true idols.  He's a brilliant musician.  Of course the general public will always associate him with his unexpected pop radio hit from the 80s, but he is a musician of the highest caliber with an extensive career.  His jazz, classical, and "crossover" recordings are a thing of rare beauty.  I like pretty much all of his recordings, but in particular I recommend you listen to the following.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://store.bobbymcferrin.com/papermusic.html">Paper Music</a>.  This is a classical recording with Bobby conducting and singing on some tracks.  Listen to the Tchaikovsky <b>Andante Cantabile</b>.  This recording is otherworldly in its grace and elegance.  At the end you are compelled to fall to your knees and weep.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://store.bobbymcferrin.com/beyondwords.html">Beyond Words</a> is a great recording of Bobby's specialty vocals.  You will find "Invocation" sampled on some pop and hip-hop tracks these days as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://store.bobbymcferrin.com/medicinemusic.html">Medicine Music</a> has great, fun songs, especially <b>Baby</b>, and <a href="http://store.bobbymcferrin.com/circlesongs.html">Circlesongs</a> is great for meditation, yoga, and relaxation.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Queen</h3>
<p>
I've been hopelessly obsessed with Queen ever since their Wayne's World revival.  I love the orchestral and progressive nature of their sound.  Freddie and Brian in particular are pure genius.  Most of it is just great sounding fun entertaining music, but I find both <b>Tenement Fuster</b> and <b>39</b> to be works of art in the first class.
</p>
<h3>Wynton Marsalis</h3>
<p>
I find Wynton's role as ambassador very inspiring.  He's a great virtuouso, composer, and figurehead.  I never hear much talk about <a href="http://www.wyntonmarsalis.org/discography/jazz/blood-on-the-fields/">Blood on the Fields</a>, but I consider it to be a consummate masterpiece of long-form jazz composition.  If you haven't heard it, and have a long airplane ride coming up, set aside some focused time to check it out.  It's 3 CDs long though, but there's amazing writing, playing, and singing in there.
</p>
<h3>Steve Reich</h3>
<p>
Largely thanks to <a href="/problog/2009/03/music-subscription-and-rhapsody/">Rhapsody</a>, I've become a big Steve Reich fan.  I listened to a box set of 30 years of his work while coding and got hooked.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000005J4P/howardstokarmana">Works: 1965-1995</a> is a great collection.  My favorite is the slow movement from <b>Electric Counterpoint</b>, which is stunningly beautiful.
</p>
<h3>Philip Glass</h3>
<p>
Another great minimalist classical composer, Philip Glass has a great aesthetic.  His music is great for coding and he has written several gorgeous film scores.
</p>
<h3>Imogen Heap</h3>
<p>
What's not to love about this charming Brit?  Her work on Frou Frou <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Details-Frou/dp/B00006EXLQ/ref=pd_sim_m_4">Details</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Speak-Yourself-Imogen-Heap/dp/B000B7BZM4">Speak for Yourself</a> is fantastic.  I got to see her on the last US tour for Ellipse, which was fun.  She's a great character and has a great aesthetic.  Her big hit <b>Hide and Seek</b> is haunting.  She's pretty much the queen of audience connection and is paving new paths there pulling content from her fans.
</p>
<h3>Zoe Keating</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.zoekeating.com/">Zoe</a> is a cellist who creates overdubbed loops of her cello in real time.  Her music is really unique and beautiful. She's one of my main inspirations to get my Eigenharp. Got to see her when she came to Chautauqua.
