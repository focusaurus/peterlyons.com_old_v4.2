Thanks for visiting my web site.  Here you will find some music, some
software, and some photographs. I used to try to update this page with
news at least a few times a year, but lately I've been too busy and
have decided just to link you to the web sites for my blog and my former bands.
</p>

<p>
I am currently on an adventure exploring out west.  You can read about it on <a href="http://focusaurus.livejournal.com/">my blog</a>.

<a
href="http://www.sunnydaze.ws">Sunny Daze</a> is the six piece Acid
Jazz/Funk/Latin band I played in from 2001-2007. The band in that formation is no longer active due to relocations and babies.
Please check out the web site for our albums, sound clips, photos, and info.
