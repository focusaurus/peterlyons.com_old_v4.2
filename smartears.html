Check out my new (Summer 2001) ear training program.  This program
will help you quickly learn to recognize and identify common musical
structures including intervals, scales/modes, and chords.

My java friends who don't want to mess around with Java Web Start can download <a href="smartears.jar">smartears.jar</a> and launch the application by typing:<br>
java -jar SmartEars.jar
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, for Windows 98, the Java Runtime Environment does not
include any Sound Banks.  SmartEars should still run, but you will not
be able to change the timbre of the sound. If you would like to be
able to select different sounds, see the instructions 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/soundbank-install.html">here</a>,
and then download either the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/soundbank-min.gm.zip">minimal
(0.35MB)</a>, 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/soundbank-mid.gm.zip">midsize
(1.09MB)</a>, or 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/soundbank-deluxe.gm.zip">deluxe
(4.92MB)</a> soundbanks.
</p>
<p>
Using SmartEars should be (I hope!) largely self-explanatory and easy.  Two quick tips:
<ul>
<li>To turn off certain answers you are not intrested in (eg. unisons and octaves) right-click on their button (Command-click on OS X)</li>
<li>To hear sounds played simultaneously (as a chord) instead of arpeggiated, click into the Settings Tab and set the Note Delay to 0</li>
</ul>
