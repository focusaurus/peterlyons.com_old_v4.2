</ul></div><div class="phase"><h1>Phase 3A: Software Engineer at Opsware</h1>

<p>Dates: June 2006-November 2007</p>

<p>I changed roles and joined the main product engineering team at Opsware, focusing on our bare metal OS provisioning feature.  I soon moved into the technical lead role for this feature and began guiding the design and implementation.  There were several notable changes leading a team building enterprise software.  I now had several engineers working with me on projects, QA teams, documentation writers, and product managers to work with.  The release cycle was between 8 and 12 months or so, so it was long projects with a lot of detailed design work, planning and specification. The work was technically very detailed - diving into the guts of three major platform families (Windows, Linux, and Solaris) and supporting several major hardware architectures. There were also lots of open bugs in numerous prior releases to manage and somewhat frequent escalated customer support cases. Also this was my first exposure to a truly gigantic (millions of lines) code base with dozens of components in many languages.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Maintained and improved a large, mature, and complex code base. This includes making careful trade-off decisions around product functionality, defect management, and quickly resolving top-priority customer escalations</li>
</ul>

</ul></div><div class="phase"><h1>Phase 2B: Consultant at Opsware</h1>

<p>Dates: August 2004-June 2006</p>

<p>Fearing spending my whole career as a Microsoft expert when in general I was not fond of Microsoft technology, I decided to take a job with a small software company called Opsware, Inc at the recommendation of a friend.  Opsware was selling data center automation software which at this point was still very new.  It was the vision of Internet pioneer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a>.  After Netscape, Marc founded LoudCloud which was a hosting provider focused on automation and scale-on-demand technology which they developed in-house.  In 2003 they pivoted, selling the hosting business to EDS and taking their software directly to market as Opsware, Inc.</p>

<p>This was a very sudden and significant technology change for me.  I went from all Windows all the time to working at large-scale Unix/Linux heavy shops. Opsware professional services was comprised of entirely hard-core elite sysadmin/programmers, some having come over from Sun Microsystems professional services.  This was a very small team of only a handful of people responsible for all customers in the eastern US.  The stakes were high as Opsware was still very much a young and problematic enterprise software application, and it was up to professional services to fill in the gaps between what the customers&#39; needs and expectations were and what the product could actually deliver.  We were also seen as sources of best practices for system administration by our clients, who were already often cutting-edge technologists interested in automation.  After spending 20 months doing Windows, they sat me down in front of 1500 Solaris servers at Comcast and said "sink or swim".  I swam.</p>

<p>This job was a mix of consulting, systems administration, and custom software development, gradually shifting toward more and more software development with each new project.  We ended up writing large pieces of custom software for our customers in Java and Python.  My client focus was on the financial services customers on Wall Street and Exchange Place in Jersey City.  I spent time at many of the largest financial firms including JP Morgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Technical lead for the Eastern US, providing best practices, guidance, procedures, and support to less experienced team members</li>
<li>Developed enhancements to meet the needs of large financial services clients. Enhanced Opsware&#39;s Solaris Patching capabilities for deeper automation. Created program to synchronize user accounts with an external LDAP directory. Developed new web GUIs for customer-specific enhancements.</li>
<li>Worked closely with customers to design, plan, and implement Opsware Server Automation System to automate management of complex, large-scale, heterogeneous, enterprise data centers</li>
<li>Provided troubleshooting, analysis, and technical expertise in high-pressure, escalated production problems</li>
<li>Successfully upgraded nearly every Opsware customer in the Eastern US. Used precision and careful, thorough planning to turn nightmare, disaster-prone on-site product upgrades into successes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dates: November 2002-August 2004</p>

<p>In the tough economy after 9/11, I took a position at a new subsidiary of <a href="http://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> called <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/accenture-technology-solutions">Accenture Technology Solutions</a> (ATS).  ATS was formed to add more technical depth to Accenture&#39;s staff of consultants.  Here I got exposure to large enterprises and became a jack-of-all-trades technologist.  We were building projects on the Microsoft platform.  I got to spend time both programming new applications as well as building the data center cages where we hosted the applications from scratch.  I learned networking in detail and became a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) and got to configure Cisco switches and routers.  I became heavily involved in projects to the level where I would assist with selecting and purchasing equipment (racks, servers, cables, switches), physically racking, stacking, and cabling it in the data center, installing the operating systems (using automation scripts I had written), installing and configuring MS Exchage Server, Active Directory, and ISA Server, configuring the switches and networking topology, and coordinating with the data center staff on our Internet connection and firewall rules.  I also helped provision and configure a dedicated T1 line we used for administrative access out of band from our office to the data center.</p>

<p>I got exposure to large, complex, high-budget (8-figure) projects and the logistics of navigating that.  My primary client during this period was AT&amp;T and I was also involved with Payless Shoes and Jelly Belly Candy Company.</p>

</ul></div><div class="phase"><h1>Phase 1: Web Development</h1>

<p>Dates: August 2001-September 2002</p>

<p>My first full-time job straight out of college was at a boutique web development
consultancy in NYC called <a href="http://codefab.com/">CodeFab</a>. This was a
small (approx 20 employees at its largest) shop formed by a core group of old
die-hard NeXTSTEP/OpenStep enthusiasts. We built database-driven web
applications on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/webobjects/">Apple
WebObjects</a> platform. We used the <a
href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a> methodology
which involes full-time <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>. This
pairing afforded me a great opportunity to learn from many veteran developers,
many of whom are now working at Apple. We were also heavily invested in unit
testing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test
Driven Development (TDD)</a>. Thus I learned early on what solid, well-tested
code looks and feels like.</p>

<p>Sadly, CodeFab&#39;s consulting business did not survive the post-9/11 economy and
they had to close up shop for a while, later re-emerging with a focus on
iPhone/iPad and mobile development.</p>

<p>I should also note that at this time I started to learn Python on the side,
taking a cue from my boss <a
href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=12829">Bill Bumgarner</a>. This
turned out to be a key language two jobs later at Opsware.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developed and maintained numerous sophisticated database driven web applications including a real-time trading system</li>
<li>Integrated diverse technologies such as email (JavaMail), LDAP directories (JNDI), XML-RPC, and WebDAV</li>
<li>Created transparent, on-the-fly database upgrade system that significantly reduced the downtime, risk and complexity of updating production software. This design was later written up in StepWise and is now common in application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, but this was in 2002!</li>
<li>Designed, developed, and integrated centralized, single sign-on authentication system that allowed employees to use multiple web applications without needing to reauthenticate</li>
