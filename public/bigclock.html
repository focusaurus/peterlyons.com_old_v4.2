window with a clock, so you can get a clock of any size. It allows you
to choose your own colors and time format.
You can launch it through Java Web Start with the
link below, or <a href="./dist/bigclock.jar">download the jar file directly</a>
and run it with the command &#39;java -jar bigclock.jar&#39;
using JRE 1.3 or newer.</p>

<p><a href="./dist/bigclock.jnlp">Start BigClock!</a></p><p>
I am distributing the program using a technology called Java Web
Start which will let you launch it from the web or from your
computer, and will take care of keeping your version up
to date automatically. If you have never run a Web Start program before,
you will need to first install Java Web Start on your computer by visiting
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/</a>
</p>
<p>
Once you've got Java Web Start, you can download and launch
the program by clicking the link above.  Once you have dowloaded
it once, Java Web Start will save the program on your computer, so
the next time you launch it (either from this web page or through the
Java Web Start application on your computer) it will start up right
away.  As I release updates, Java Web Start will automatically make
sure you have the latest files.
</p>
<p>If you've got the Java Runtime Environment 1.3 or newer and Java
Web Start installed, you should be all set. Web start works on Windows
95/98/NT/2000/XP. It is installed and configured by default on Mac OS
X, so if you're using IE on OS X, you should be able to just click the
link above. On Linux, I have gotten it to work with Mozilla,
Konqueror, and Netscape 4.76 with no difficulty.  When you install
Java Web Start, it will update the ~/.mime-types files to include the
.jnlp mapping needed for Java Web Start, and Netscape should see this,
but I had to go and manually update my Netscape preferences to include
the path to the javaws binary and then a '%s'.  To do this, go to the
Edit menu-->Preferences-->Navigator-->Applications and scroll down
until you find the one that says "Java Web Start" in the description
column.  Then hit Edit and check the box where it says Application,
and in the text field next to it, put the path to your web start
javaws (eg. /usr/local/java/javaws/javaws) binary followed by ' %s',
and that should do it.  For Mozilla and Konqueror, and other browsers,
you just need to go into the "Helper Applications" type section of the
preferences and map the .jnlp extension and/or the
application/x-java-jnlp-file mime type to the javaws executable.
Please <a href="mailto:pete@peterlyons.com">e-mail me</a> with your
stories of successes/failures on various platforms and browsers.  Note
that the classic Macintosh OS does not support Java 2, so only OS X
users can expect this to work.
