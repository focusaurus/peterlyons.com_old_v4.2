OK, I've made it through Holiday and moving insanity 2007!&nbsp; I flew in to Newark late night Sunday the 16th and worked from the Opsware NYC office most of that week.&nbsp; I was staying in my Hoboken apartment and trying to coordinate a bunch of logistics.&nbsp; I also had some NYC errands to run including getting my alto sax regulated and getting my watch repaired. Oh yeah, and I still had a good bit of Christmas shopping to take care of.
</p><p>
The following Saturday my Dad drove out to Hoboken and we loaded up his car with some of the final remaining personal belongings I had in storage in the basement of my Hoboken apartment (books, scuba gear, etc). Saturday afternoon/evening I went with my parents to two movies back to back: The Kite Runner then Charlie Wilson's War.&nbsp; Both were well done.
</p><p>
Then began the holiday feasting.&nbsp; Sunday we were at the Zippis for the December birthdays. Monday Christmas Eve we were at Kate and Steve's, and Christmas at my parents'.&nbsp; It was lots of good food and good fun.&nbsp; Sunday I played some of the Bach cello suites I've been practicing at the party.
</p><p>
Wednesday morning we had pancakes and conversation.&nbsp; When Frankie mentioned that "Hanukkah was done a week before Christmas this year", Mom chimed in with "Who's Annika?".&nbsp; Then I took Mom's car back to Hoboken for the last minute fire sale of all my furniture.&nbsp; So I blasted out about 10 craigslist ads and begun coordinating with lots of strangers to sell my stuff.
</p><p>
Thursday and Friday involved lots of craigslist emails and calls, selling some stuff, and lots of packing.&nbsp; Unfortunately I was unable to locate buyers for a lot of my furniture.&nbsp; I was worried that I would have to rent a van on Saturday and haul a bunch of it to my parents' house.&nbsp; However, after conferring with Chris and double checking the Hoboken garbage policy, I determined I could put pretty much any furniture out on the curb Friday night after 9pm and the trash guys would take it.
</p><p>
So thus in earnest began the great "beasting" of my furniture out to the curb. This consisted of a 2-piece sofa, a queen size mattress and box spring, a dresser, a cabinet, and a book case.&nbsp; See the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beast&amp;page=2">Urban Dictionary definition number 9</a> for the verb "to beast".&nbsp; Basically, I'm using this verb to describe the process by which a single person gets all that furniture out of his apartment, around a narrow awkward corner, down a flight of stairs, and out 2 doors to the curb.&nbsp; So after a while of that and a penultimate loading of miscellaneous boxes of stuff into the car, I drove back to Lambertville to sleep being as my bed was now out on the curb in the rain.&nbsp; I was nervous about getting fined because the information I had seemed to indicate I might have needed to call ahead in order to throw away all that furniture, and also that I needed to wrap the matress and box springs in plastic, neither of which I had done.&nbsp; Since at this point it was just very mildly drizzling I wasn't too worried about the plastic since the garbage collection would be happening shortly anyway.&nbsp; Of course, as I set out toward Lambertville, this changed to an all out downpour.&nbsp; Sorry about that, garbage collection folks.
</p><p>
Here's me just after the beasting.&nbsp; By chance on Saturday I checked the mail at my parents' house, and I found that my extra keys had arrived from Boston.&nbsp; So I went and shipped them off to the new tenant and purchased a poster tube which meant my beloved Queen posters would survive the move.

The spoils of a good beasting.

Anyway, I was greatly relieved that I didn't have to rent a van/truck.&nbsp; I drove back again Saturday morning to meet the person who was buying my coffee table - the last piece of furniture in the apartment, and do the final sweeping and cleaning.&nbsp; Once that was taken care of I headed in to the NYC office to rest up a bit before meeting Chris to go watch UFC on the big screen at Madison Square Garden.&nbsp; First we had a very nice meal at a cafe on 23rd street.&nbsp; Then on the way back I gave Chris my stereo from my apartment and left the keys inside and completed the final exit.&nbsp; I enjoyed my stay there for the past two years.
</p><p>
Then another long long drive to Lambertville and much needed sleep.&nbsp; Sunday morning a friend of my parents took me to the bus pickup point and I took a long, crowded bus ride to the airport.&nbsp; I flew out to Denver, got a bus to my car at the parking lot, and drove to Boulder.&nbsp; My Aunt, Uncle, and two cousins had also just flown back from Mexico at the same time and arrived back in Boulder just an hour or so before I did.
</p><p>
So I stayed with them Sunday night and Monday for their New Years party.&nbsp; I also played some Bach cello suites - at this point I've covered pretty much all my Aunts and Uncles except for Jane and Dennis with Suite No. 1.&nbsp; Next time it will be the more brooding No. 2.
</p><p>
Today after blueberry pancakes for breakfast I drove about 5 minutes across Boulder to the house I've rented for January.&nbsp; I met the owner and the two cats I will be cat sitting - Samui and Phuket (islands in Thailand).&nbsp; So now I've moved in and stocked up on groceries and looking forward to just enjoying a few moments of calm before I have to again search craigslist in earnest for February housing (hopefully in Park City, Utah).

More photos of the new house and the kitties tomorrow.
