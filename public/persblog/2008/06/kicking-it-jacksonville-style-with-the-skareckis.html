Well, I'm having an exciting and lovely time here in Jacksonville. I<br />arrived Saturday night.  Sunny had stayed up late to meet me, so I<br />went into her bedroom to say goodnight.  She didn't recognize me with<br />my shaggy hair, but she played it cool.  Eventually we convinced her I<br />was the same person.  Marc and Casey and I chilled out and caught up<br />Saturday night.
</p>
<p>
Sunday morning Casey and Sunny made Marc a delicious Father's Day<br />breakfast, served initially in bed, but quickly followed up with an<br />invitation to join the rest of us in the dining room.  After breakfast<br />we headed out to the beach.  The beach we went to is out across some<br />packed sand flats, and you can drive your car directly to the tide<br />line on the beach and just park there, which is a bit odd, but must be<br />great for the folks there in their RVs.  Sadly, the weather was pretty<br />cloudy and quickly turning to rain with thunder and lightning, so the<br />beach patrol was soon clearing everybody out of the water.  Now the<br />rain is a bit of a problem given two of the windows in the Skarecki<br />Volvo don't close, so we had to improvise some shelter by hanging<br />towels over the windows.  Later on we took Sunny to see Indiana Jones<br />and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull at the San Marco theater - which<br />serves snacks and beers.

Monday Marc had to leave for a road trip for work.  I was working from<br />home and Sunny and Casey were out and about in the morning.  They came<br />back to pick me up to go out to lunch.  Casey had a few navigation<br />issues that resulted in us crossing the blue bridge four total times.<br />Eventually we arrived at the Jacksonville Hooters restaurant, on the<br />banks of the St Johns River.  This was a bit of an experience.  They<br />had golf playing on so many TVs set at maximum volume that you got the<br />combined effect of the tinny, blaring sound plus the delay effect from<br />TVs around the restaurant made it sound like air raid sirens and that<br />Tiger Woods was attacking from above.  We shouted our conversation to<br />compensate for the din.<br /><br />When we arrived back at home, we found the power and water were not<br />working.  Ut oh.  Casey offered another trip back into the city so I<br />could work from the Jacksonville Public Library.  So back again over<br />the bridge we went. I got settled in the library and Casey made calls<br />to figure out why the power and water were out.  Eventually she found<br />out there was some issue that had caused the house to be "flagged" and<br />an electrician would need to come out tomorrow and do something to get<br />the power back on.  Casey called me in the evening when the library<br />was closing to say that she had checked in to the Crowne Plaza with<br />Sunny for the night.  So they came by and picked me up and we went for<br />a dusk swim in the pool.  The view from the balcony of the lights and<br />bridges along the St Johns River was really pretty.  Casey and Sunny<br />were gushing at how fancy and posh the hotel was.  After our swim we<br />had a late dinner at Al's Pizza in Five Points just prior to closing.<br />Back at the hotel, again more gushing over the luxurious<br />accommodations, including Casey's exclamation "The bed doesn't have any<br />sand in it!".

<p>
The next morning Casey put on her fancy interview suit to go in to the<br />city and get the power straightened out.  Sunny pleaded for a quick<br />swim in the pool before they checked out.  I walked across the bridge<br />back to the library to work.  Casey got the power worked out and later<br />that afternoon after a few technician visits the power and water were<br />back on.
</p>
<p>
Tuesday evening we biked to a neighbor's house for a dinner party<br />featuring gumbo and rum punch.  Marc got back from his road trip and<br />joined us there.  It was a late night with lots of rum punch and<br />discussion of politics out back in the heat and mosquitoes.  People<br />alternated going in to play with Sunny and Maya.  After my stint it<br />was after midnight and I was exhausted so I had to take the early trip<br />home and the rock stars came back later.
</p>
<p>
Wednesday was a more mellow day at home with a nice dinner followed by<br />crowding onto the bed where the TV with HBO is to watch Hairspray,<br />which Sunny loves.  Then we played some dominoes.

Thursday Marc and I took off work to try the beach again. We had much better weather.

Saturday we piled all four of us into Marc's mini cooper and drove up to Savannah.  This saved me from a bus ride, which was great.  We met up with my folks for Bar-B-Que at Wall's - a small joint in a tiny alley.  Then we left the Skareckis to explore Savannah while we hit the road for Hilton Head Island. Sadly it started to rain immediately, which I'm sure put a damper on the Savannah sight seeing.
