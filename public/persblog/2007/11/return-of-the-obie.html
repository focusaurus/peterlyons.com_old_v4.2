Saturday I made my way out to Oberlin, Ohio.&nbsp; The drive took a full eight hours from my parents' place in Lambertville.&nbsp; Thank God for all the new music I have on my mp3 player from the Rhapsody music subscription service.&nbsp; I'll be loading up on Bill Cosby and maybe some audio books for the next big chunk of the journey.
</p>
<p>
It was good timing because Saturday night was the Oberlin Jazz Ensemble concert.&nbsp; I arrived in Elyria with just enough time for a quick nap at the hotel, and then the 20 minute drive to Oberlin.&nbsp; The program was the music of Illinois Jacquet, and the band was sounding pretty good.
</p>
<p>
After the concert I took a quick walk through the Conservatory and then hit The Feve cafe for some food.&nbsp; The Feve has been remodeled and the menu has changed from crunchy hippie cafe to more college bar food.&nbsp; Apparently, they are allowed to hire wait staff with no visible piercings, which was completely verboten during my years as a patron.
</p>
<p>
I spent almost all day Sunday preparing the slides for my presentations and making the finishing touches.&nbsp; I went in to Oberlin for dinner at the Mandarin and some saxophone practice.
</p>
<p>
On Monday I went out to lunch with the Computer Science faculty, only one of whom I took classes with during my tenure.&nbsp; It was amusing to talk with them.&nbsp; During my student days, there was a well-known phenomenon of the Oberlin "bubble" basically describing students' views gradually becoming disconnected from the realities of the non-Oberlin universe, but I wasn't really aware of the term being applied to professors.&nbsp; However, the conversation here definitely made me think that professors can get trapped in the bubble as well.
</p>
<p>
It was nice to be back on campus while classes were in session and see the Obies do their thing. Even the obligatory CS student attending class in a bathrobe was sighted.&nbsp; I gave my presentation to about 9 CS students and most of the faculty in the afternoon.&nbsp; The material I had ended up being better than I had initially thought and although it was hard to get a reading on them, I think most of the students benefited from the material.
</p>
<p>
Afterward, two members of the CS Majors Committee took me out to dinner.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday I attended the "Professional Development for Musicians" class.&nbsp; It was a guest lecture by two Oberlin grads that are now members of the<a href="http://www.imaniwinds.com/"> Imani Winds</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; woodwind quintet discussing their experience as professional chamber musicians.&nbsp; That afternoon I gave my other presentation to the conservatory students.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as these things often go, there were only four people there.&nbsp; I guess this is disappointing but understandable when you consider how busy these students are and that I am not Yo-Yo Ma. (My talk was promoted as a "Master Class", and usually these are given by world-renowned musicians).
</p>
<p>
After that I started the bulk of my cross country drive.&nbsp; I tried to do at least three hours a day while still working from hotels each day.&nbsp; I stayed at a very bad Ramada in Terre Haute, Indiana and a very nice Holiday Inn near St. Louis. At the Ramada I should have sensed bad news when I asked the manager if they had high speed internet and he replied "You mean Hi-Fi?".&nbsp; After pondering, I said "yes", and apparently they did.&nbsp; When I asked if I needed any settings or passwords to connect he said "No just plug in to rlap1 or whatever you do".&nbsp; Clearly, he's not a frequent guest of the information superhighway, even though he was a young guy.&nbsp; In any case, as I have encountered twice already, the wi-fi didn't actually function in the room.&nbsp; Copper wire just can't be beaten for reliability, people.
</p>
<p>
The Holiday Inn here in Collinsville, Illinois is very nice and the wi-fi works great, so I'm going to stay two nights.&nbsp; I've only got about 16 hours driving to Santa Fe, so I should get there on Sunday no problem.
