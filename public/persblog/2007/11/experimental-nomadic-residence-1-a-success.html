<p>
I listened to a lot of music and stand up comedy in the car.&nbsp; I had some Lewis Black and some of the old classic Bill Cosby albums.&nbsp; I was laughing out loud for a good long time at Lewis Black's bit about whether or not frozen stem cells are alive.&nbsp; He screams "THEY'RE FROZEN" at the top of his lungs about thirty times in a row.&nbsp; The great thing about listening to the Bill Cosby routines was I got to do direct back to back listenings of the Eddie Izzard bit on Noah and the ark followed by the Bill Cosby version.&nbsp; Both involve the comedian imitating the sound of Noah sawing wood for the ark.&nbsp; My Dad quotes the Bill Cosby version a lot, so I'd like to play him the Eddie Izzard version and see what he thinks.&nbsp; They are both pretty hysterical.
</p>
<p>
I also played my entire <a href="http://imogenheap.com/">Imogen Heap</a> collection.&nbsp; I figure most of you don't know of her, but she's a British "electropop" singer/songwriter and she's a frigging powerhouse dynamo.&nbsp; I think he voice is just amazing and her songs are really great.&nbsp; I was blasting "Hide and Seek" really loud and singing along while I drove across beautiful plains next to awe-inspiring wind farms full of huge windmills in Texas.&nbsp; It was a great moment.&nbsp; That song consistently gives me goosebumps.
</p>
<p>
Of course, for me Queen "The Miracle" is mandatory on any road trip longer than six hours.&nbsp; I also often do the entire 3-CD Wynton Marsalis "Blood on the Fields", but that will have to wait until the next trip.
</p>
<p>
So anyway, there was some great serene scenery, lots of cruise control, and enough music to keep me comfortable.
</p>
<p>
I saw a total of 5 crosses larger than thirty feet tall, three of which were over fifty feet tall.&nbsp; They sure can't get enough of Jesus in Texas.
</p>
<p>
The transition from the boring and somewhat dreary looking plains in the Texas panhandle to the striking brush-covered desert of New Mexico was sudden and dramatic.&nbsp; As I entered New Mexico I watched a long slow sunset redden the sky. There was pretty much nothing man-made visible across my entire field of vision for about an hour.&nbsp; It was just gorgeous.
</p>
<p>
Today the adventure began in earnest.&nbsp; I did some craigslist searching and google mapping prior to checkout of the hotel in the morning.&nbsp; I went and visited the neighborhood where one of the houses I was looking to rent was.&nbsp; I didn't know the exact address and couldn't spot it from the pictures, but the neighborhood was nice.&nbsp; I got a local paper and looked through the classifieds while I did a load of laundry at a laundromat.&nbsp; The laundromat crowd here was a lot more colorful and less depressing than I am accustomed to.&nbsp; I placed a bunch of phone calls for apartments and made an appointment to see one that afternoon.
</p>
<p>
After the laundry and some unsuccessful war driving looking for open wi-fi networks hoping the woman renting the house would respond back, I had a little time to kill before my apartment appointment so I walked through the main Santa Fe plaza and generally scoped things out.
</p>
<p>
At two in the afternoon I rendezvoused with Beth to see this 2BR apartment. We met in a well-marked parking lot and I followed her to the place as it is at the back of a small alley and would have been impossible for me to find via directions.&nbsp; The place was just OK for my criteria.&nbsp; I wanted a house as opposed to an apartment so I could play sax there.&nbsp; It was a little pricey and there was no Internet connection, so that means I'd have to work from a hotel for another day or two while that was connected.&nbsp; So I wanted to wait and see this other place in case it was better.
</p>
<p>
OK, so this is when the day got "colorful".&nbsp; So Beth left and I sat in my car looking at my map.&nbsp; The next stop was going to be a 50 mile drive to a town called Rio Rancho outside of Albuquerque since there was a nice apartment there that I knew was available and I was probably going to rent even though it was not a house and not in Santa Fe.&nbsp; However, the owner of the condo above the place I had just looked at came out and knocked on my car window.&nbsp; She introduced herself and was relieved to hear that I had not signed a lease with Beth.&nbsp; The weakness of my writing skills is probably going to show here, so I'll have to explain this little episode verbally when I talk to you.&nbsp; Anyway, she (just like Beth) has the standard issue middle-aged lesbian haircut, and she goes on to tell me a bunch of dirt about Beth and that she's charging too much for the place and so forth.&nbsp; She says she grew up in Santa Fe in a nearby neighborhood and that there are a bunch of apartments for rent there that would be cheaper.&nbsp; She then says that if I follow her in her car, she'll drive me past them.&nbsp; This is exactly the kind of local color I'm hoping to get, so I agree.&nbsp; She goes in to the apartment to get her keys and comes back with a woman that I presume is her partner and they hop in their white SUV and off we go.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and she says that she'll go a little ways and then pull over so we can talk, in case Beth comes back with another prospective renter.
</p>
<p>
So off we go.&nbsp; When we're safely out of the path Beth might be on, she pulls over and chats me up about Santa Fe neighborhoods and so forth.&nbsp; She's extremely nice and helpful.&nbsp; Then she drives me a little further to a street where there are three or four places for rent via the old "For Rent" sign out front approach.&nbsp; So one by one I drive past and write down the phone numbers.&nbsp; She eventually goes on her way and I call the numbers and leave messages.&nbsp; I think she must also be either a full or part time real estate broker based on some of the things she said, but in any case, it was a funny experience.
</p>
<p>
So then I map out my route and plan to head to Albuquerque to see the place that I will probably rent.&nbsp; I just get on the highway when my phone rings and it's the woman with the house to rent in Santa Fe, which is the one I really wanted because it has all of my criteria.&nbsp; So I turn back around and go take a look at it.
</p>
<p>
So that's where I am now.&nbsp; I have rented a really nice 2BR adobe 1-floor house in a cute neighborhood about 1.5 miles from the main Santa Fe plaza.&nbsp; It's got an office with a big desk and DSL, a fireplace in the living room, a screen porch out back, and a good sized patio out back with a wood-burning grill.&nbsp; The change in my mood from when I was heading out to Albuquerque to settle for a sub-optimal apartment to when this woman finally called me back was astounding.&nbsp; I'm really delighted here and amazed that I was able to just drive into Santa Fe, check craigslist, and find a short term fully furnished house with everything I need for hundreds of dollars less than what I pay in Hoboken. It's going to be really nice to be able to play my sax without having to ride a train there and back.
