Saturday I went with Horatiu to the Transilvania Expo, a clothing market that they have in Cluj each year for a few days.&nbsp; I bought a fleece, and just in time, too as I brought only T-shirts and a light windbreaker and was in need of something warmer.
</p>
<p>
After the market we had some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mititei">Mititei</a> (Romanian grilled sausages), which were quite tasty.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Next stop was a cell phone store.&nbsp; I needed to get a cell phone in case work needed to reach me for some customer support issues over the weekend, so we stopped at a nearby store and got me all set up.
</p>
<p>
Then we took a road trip to Turda, about 30 kilometers away.&nbsp; Horatiu demonstrated his comprehensive knowledge of every speed camera along the way, which he laments "double the time it takes to get to Turda".&nbsp; In Turda, we visited the Maria Tereza Salt Mine (<a href="http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salina_Turda">Salina Turda</a>).
</p>
<p>
This place was really cool. First you walk about 300 meters down a gradually sloped tunnel into the mine.&nbsp; If they didn't mark the distances from the entrance on the wall and someone turned you around in there, it'd be tricky to tell just by looking which was was out.&nbsp; This leads to a series of larger square tunnels.&nbsp; The tunnels have the feel of early first person shooter 3D video games because they are so geometrically simple and long.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
First we entered a large echo chamber.&nbsp; Man, how I'd love to go back with my sax.&nbsp; We then proceeded into a room with a large wooden crank that was turned by a team of horses to power some of the mining equipment.&nbsp; This is straight out of Indiana Jones stuff.
</p>
<p>
Then you climb about 8 or 9 stories of very steep wooden steps down into the main mine chamber.&nbsp; This place is enormous and full of fascinating patterns on the walls and in the salt stalactites.&nbsp; The local people believe the air in the mine to be theraputic, so there was an old women sitting there with her knitting and a couple playing badminton.
</p>

</p>
<p>
After the mine we headed to the big gorge in Turda, which is really fun to hike around and visually stunning.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Now, this extended outing wasn't exactly well planned. Had I known we were going to be hiking so far and so long, I would have brought some snacks and water.&nbsp; But this was very spur of the moment.&nbsp; So after two hours or so of hiking up the gorge, sometimes needing to hold onto a steel cable hung from the rock face at narrow spots where the rocks were slippery, we needed some food.
</p>
<p>
We stopped at a bakery/cafe in Turda with really good cakes that Horatiu is crazy about.&nbsp; We had some and he took a few home with him.
</p>
<p>
Back in Cluj, I left Horatiu and took a little rest (so far we've only covered noon to 6pm).&nbsp; Later I joined up with Jeremy and Randall.&nbsp; We went to Lugano, the best restaurant in Cluj.&nbsp; We were joined by Allison, a very quirky young Canadian girl who has been living in Cluj for seven months working as a translator.&nbsp; Later Bogdan joined us and swore that he assumed Allison spoke Romanian natively.&nbsp; It was a very nice and memorable dinner.&nbsp; You get a really interesting dynamic with this crowd: me, Bogdan (a Cluj local), Allison (Canadian), Jeremy (North Carolina and self-describedly "country"), and Randall from Seattle.
</p>
<p>
The food was good and I was starving, so I really enjoyed it.
</p>
<p>
Next stop was club Euphoria.&nbsp; We hung out there for a while.&nbsp; This is where we spotted the woman currently holding the status of best looking on the trip.&nbsp; Randall was beside himself.&nbsp; Going to and from the coat check gave me ample practice for pretty much the only Romanian I know: scuzati-ma.&nbsp; You basically have to wedge yourself through people to move.
</p>
<p>
After we tired of the crowds we went around the corner to Escala, a nice downstairs bar to meet up with the British contingent.&nbsp; This bar was not at all crowded, so we took over a big section of it and hung out until the wee hours.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, after doing all that Saturday, I took it easy on Sunday.
